It's lovely to walk around and look at the plants and trees that were planted many years ago.\n\nThe guided tour was worth it and it was lovely that we were given a scrumptious vegetarian meal. The only down side I think is the show that they showed, it was some national geographic or BBC film. I think it would be better to show more slides/films about the forest instead of generic show.",

You can expect to learn information across a wide variety of topics, including zero-waste, composting, water conservation, and vegan cooking. The different types of volunteering range from low to high physical work, but all of it was a welcome change from desk work. With the volunteering I had the opportunity to develop new skills and knowledge, such as different methods of planting new trees or how to make coconut milk from scratch. I loved being part of the Sadhana Forest community and spending quality time with the people here. Everyone is ready to listen and lend a helping hand.

You learn so much here, and you can really bring your full self to the community. No one judges you and everyone is so welcoming. The work itself is so meaningful - helping to regrow the natural forest here, cooking for the community, cleaning, preparing water irrigation devices. In that way, you also learn a lot about conservation, sustainability and plant-based diets. These are all things you can bring back and integrate into your life at home. If you\u2019re already thinking about coming here, think no further - do it!!",

I get to put my believes in action again and reconnect to parts of myself I hadn\u2019t accessed in a long time. The community is really a safe space and really takes all the social anxiety off you. Also constantly living in the forest helps regulate the nervous system well with all the forest bathing that happens. Doing hands on physical work also helped me learn and start taking care of my body again. And considering the resource footprint minimisation while staying here is an added advantage. And you do all this while helping sustain an evergreen dry forest which has been grown in a dry arid land supporting the local biodiversity and recharging ground water table. I wouldn\u2019t ask for more from a place.\n\nRead less",

I have grown up in India, so community living has always been a part of my childhood, but I never imagined living so closely with nature. Apart from indulging in seva, I learnt a lot of things about myself and it has given my life a direction, an alternative perspective. I realised that all the other species apart from humans have different personalities, moods, tantrums, emotions, experience pain, and trauma, just like humans and acknowledging all of this is very important. I also learnt to use compost toilets and to manage the compost after, which was one of my nightmares. But after I did it, I realised it's not at all how i imagined it to be. I relished some very delicious cuisine from all over the world each day I spent here. I worked and met with different people from around the world and learnt about different cultures. I have made friends for life in a very short span of time. In the process, I learnt to be compassionate, even when it's very difficult. And most importantly, I learnt to break my own mental barriers and now I can take on life with a different perspective.\n\nRead less",

At first Sadhana can feel quite different from our conventional lives, but after a few days of settling in, I really started to experience what makes this place special.

Waking up to the sounds of nature, starting the day with warm smiles in a community of people from all over the world,  doing Seva , preparing healthy vegan meals, relaxing in the serene environs, learning about different cultures, learning and contributing to sustainable practices of living by conserving water and much more is what you gain when you come to this forest.\nBeing in sync with Nature, community living  & having healthy meals, works as a catalyst for one's own self growth. I was touched by the compassion way of living here, with people and animals living in harmony with each other. It's a delight for vegan travellers for getting all 3 vegan meals and an awesome vegan Masala tea made with coconut milk and Indian spices.\nThe pace of the day allowed me to unwind in the lap of nature whilst indulging mindfully in the volunteering tasks. It was amazing to learn and engage in conserving water by practising hand washing and cleaning utensils in such simple ways.\nThe accommodation is comfortable for toddlers and adults. An experiential stay, where each day feels fulfilled and blissful.\n\nRead less",

        "review_content": "Whirlwind of fun\nMy time at Sadhana forest has been a whirlwind of fun and learning. I had no idea about this place before coming to Auroville. A friend told me that he wanted to see and go on the tour around a sustainable living community. I was happy to join him and after Luke, a long term volunteer, told us about the impact that this place has, I paused my tour around India and signed up to volunteer for 10 days. I have never made a better decision. From reforesting to tending the rescue cows, each day has been a blessing and my mind has never felt so balanced in my life.\n\nOn my first day I was welcomed in with open arms and was given the full run down of the week ahead. I was impressed by the division of sevas (selfless daily activities) and how they made the community almost completely self sufficient along side the reforestation project. These community tasks and the reforestation projects really help you bond with other volunteers who all have a similar mindset; that they want to make a positive impact on the wildlife and community in the area. Even though it has only been 10 days, I have made friendships here that I can tell will stand the test of time. Sadhana forest really has a family feel here and I can now even consider it a home.\n\nOn to the food. A guilty admission, I am neither Vegan or Vegetarian outside of the forest, but have been cooked and served a wide range of incredible foods that I would never have tried myself. From peanut butter pancakes to Thai green curries, the food here has been excellent. There has even been a request here for a Sadhana forest cookbook. I regularly drink alcohol and I have never been particularly spiritual in my life (another guilty admission). However coming here has enlightened me to other ways of living, some of which I will implement into my every day life. There is such a strong community feel that time flys by and the urge to have a beer or glass of wine with dinner completely goes.\n\nOn a side note, you will struggle to find a better deal than 600 rupees a day for food, accommodation, entertainment and a wide range of workshops all run by volunteers. For 10 days, that\u2019s 6000 rupees, which is \u00a360 for the whole experience. Absolute bargain if you ask me.\n\nNo matter if you are coming directly here or only passing by, whether it\u2019s to volunteer for 10 days or 6 months, Sadhana forest will be worth your trip. It is an excellent insight into what conscious / sustainable living looks like and will teach you how it is even possible. The stay itself has given me the opportunity to explore Auroville in more detail as well as feel part of a like minded community. You will meet amazing people, have a great laugh and do some work that will actually feel meaningful. I can only thank Sadhana forest for the opportunity to volunteer here and would highly recommend to anyone else!\n\nRead less",

It was a marvelous experience and I would highly recommend this to anyone!\n\nForest.\n\nYou will have the experience of staying inside the jungle. It is wonderful to be waken up by the birds singing. Staying inside the forrest maked me calmer and more connected to myself. You can also contribute your work and go planting or watering the trees on the morning.\n\nConnecting with people and community leaving.\n\nDuring my stay in Sadhana I met many people from around the world. We spend a lot of time working together, eating together and having great conversations. Sharing joy and difficulties together was a great pleasure. I hope friendships i made in Sadhana will last for a long time.Quite often people were making workshops on different topics so it was never boring. I enjoyed this community life much more than isolated life the western culture!\n\nVeganism and healthy lifestyle.\n\nThe food in Sadhana is 100% vegan. Very fresh and unprocessed. The meals are delicious and give you power for work. After couple of days I started to enjoy not drinking coffee, cause feel more healthy and balanced. Suprisingly I even found it good to wake up early cause you can observe beatiful light after the dawn and the day was so long. During the day it was rather busy so I was not using my phone that much, which makes me more calm and mindful.\n\nTrying yourself in different tasks.\n\nDuring my stay in Sadhana I was watering small trees in the forest, cooking meals for community, preparing the fire wood, cleaning after meals, serving people food, helping at the cow sanctuary, serving at the tea hut and not to forget cleaning the toilets. Was wonderful to try myslef in different tasks, to work manually and to see results of my work.\n\nI had really good time in Sadhana Forrest. Before I come i was bit tired of travelling and my stay in Sadhana helped my to get grounded and a little bit feel like at home. Hope I will come back one day!\n\nRead less",

The scale of the positive change that is made here is monumental.\n\nThis change is generated by the hard work, good will and compassion of such dedicated action oriented volunteers. It feels wonderful to be given the opportunity to contribute to this change in such a real and tangible way.\n\nI've been so inspired by how well community aspect of Sadhana functions and the fact that this can exist in tandem with such strong social and ecological change fills me with real hope for the future.\n\nLife in the forest is not luxurious. The way human needs are facilitated are so well thought out. Here you don't need to try to reduce your impact. All the systems from hand washing to food preparation are designed to automatically reduce your environmental impact. And give so much opportunity for reflection on your impact when outside the forest.\n\nI stayed at Sadhana only 2 weeks, in that time I feel I measurable change in my level of compassion, my willingness to help other beings and my sense of purpose. This place attracts truely beautiful human beings and the relationships I've formed have left me feeling more connected then ever.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to do good and are up for some hard work (seva) come to Sadhana. I can't recommend it enough.\n\nRead less",

The plan was to stay for 4 days but it\u2019s been about 3 weeks now and I\u2019ve never felt a sense of gratitude envelope me this way. .\n\nIt\u2019s been quite a journey especially connecting with wonderful people who have come from different parts of the world to share and learn about sustainable living ( linked to veganism), reforestation, water conservation and most importantly compassion which is taught through and through in every seva we partake in and to treat the animals around you the way you would treat yourself which is with love and respect.\n\nThe immense shift from the normal way of consuming media through your laptop or phone screens and working 8 hours a day to make ends meet to a mindful living where you are working towards basic but important needs such as cooking food, planting trees, ensuring cleanliness and promoting sustainable living for a better future. The simplicity of life here eliminates the question of what\u2019s your purpose or how you can be someone of greater value instead encouraging you to be grateful and mindful in every action\n\nThe focus is on selfless service and putting materialistic gains on the backburner. The idea of compassion can truly be understood here living in the forest that\u2019s always giving. I\u2019m humbled and in awe with the way of living in true unity and seeing hands on work being encouraged in an age where we are all behind screens.

It makes me feel very vibrant and gets me out of the rut of my own thinking process.\n\nThe whole place is designed to throw you out of your comfort zone, right from the dry toilets to living in a shared dormitory with fellow volunteers to working together in different sevas where you cook food for the community or clean utensils in which food is cooked or taking care of the forests and the community etc\n\nThe non judgmental space that this place provides one is another major reason for me to flock here again and again. Majority of the people who one meets here have in someway broken away from the established pattern of the society and they understand each other\u2019s mental struggles and provide space for everyone to just \u2018be\u2019 and not be this or that!\n\nThe sense of community that one feels here is something special. All the activities and the structures are thought out in such a way that people come together and get to know each other. Human relationships are a marvellous thing once you get a taste of it!\n\nI also like how people are not in a rush to achieve here. Their concern is with existing now and not with the \u2018what next?\u2019\n\nThe slowness of life here is what I really admire and would like people to experience as well.

Eating delicious vegan meals together was a favourite part of my day, and rewarding after challenging work. The community is very organised, and so adjusting can be difficult.

        "review_content": "Sadhana Forest and it's People\nA volunteer wrote \"Let there be more forests to grow people.\" and this for me is an apt definition for Sadhana Forest and it's people. The sevas are very intense, there is so much work that on somedays it can push you beyond your comfort zones. It takes a lot to grow and maintain a forest, and at the end of the day, in sweaty t-shirts, getting through another day feels very cathartic... I come back to this place every few months, and every single time, I meet amazing people. The conversations that we have here are unlike any other place that I have experienced, it has burst all my bubbles and changed my outlook for life. There are so. many. amazing. people out there, it just blows my mind! Dear reader, if you feel like you want to connect with people who are challenging the system and showing us a way of sustainability, and of kindness to everyone we share this planet with, then this is the place for you.\n\nRead less",

        "review_content": "A sanctuary away from the chaos of city life\n\nSadhana Forest has been a transformative escape for me, a sanctuary away from the chaos of city life of Delhi. In just three days, the serene embrace of the woods has untangled my mind, leaving me feeling very lighter. The profound shift in perspective is a gift; here, life is lived with compassion and a focus on health. Amidst the trees, a diverse community converges, each individual contributing to a cause that extends beyond personal well-being. Sadhana Forest is not just a retreat; it's a communal endeavor towards positive change. People from various backgrounds unite in a shared purpose, fostering an atmosphere of unity and understanding.\n\nThe allure of veganism, explained and embraced here, becomes more than a dietary choice\u2014it's a harmonious way of living that extends kindness to animals and the environment. Contrary to common misconceptions, embracing a vegan lifestyle need not be expensive, even within the confines of a city.\nThis place is a beautiful haven where introspection meets action, creating a ripple effect of positivity. As I bask in the lightness that seeps from within, I can't help but envision a future where more individuals, seeking solace and purpose, find their way to this sanctuary in the heart of the woods.\n\nRead less",

        "review_content": "The Journey towards change and engagement.\nOn the 14th of November, 2023, I was fortunate enough to begin an inspiring journey in Sadhana Forest, a wonderful vegan community that magically filled 36 days, precisely 3,110,400 seconds, of my existence with extraordinary experiences. This community, loaded with the essence of acceptance and altruism, enveloped me in their arms and offered unfathomable love, rendering my stay in this idyllic sanctuary simply phenomenal.\nVenturing into this journey, I had the exceptional chance of participating in the illustrious Plant 4 India fellowship program that the forest offered. The opportunity not only ushered me into a world of learning but also gave me the privilege to bring about a positive impact on this green community. This whole experience has been significant in shaping my perspective towards life and strengthening my commitment towards veganism.\nIn the realm of this amazing odyssey, today marked a day of double joy. It was not just the commemorative birthday of Sadhana Forest, but also the day of celebrating the loving union of long-term volunteers, Abhilash and Sandhaya. Participating in these celebrations, reveling in the festive spirits of the community, and imbuing myself into these delightful moments has left some indelible footprints in my heart.\nIn conclusion, my stay at Sadhana Forest has been a blend of many stirring emotions, learnings, and heartening experiences. These moments have enriched me, teaching me the importance of community living, organic food cultivation and highlighting the beauty of the place where kindness and love are the only currencies. I look forward with eagerness to the remainder of my days in this forest, and to all the invaluable lessons that await me in this sustainable paradise.\n\nRead less",

        "review_content": "My experience of Sadhana Forest\nSadhana Forest to me is a home with open doors. A sustainable vegan community with warm hearts and an intention to engineer compassion in every thought process. A day in Sadhana Forest starts at 6:00am where we join in for the morning circle and then choose our sevas (selfless service). Morning sevas could include planting trees in the forest which is so much fun with our community friends. We dig trenches, discuss about native trees and learn so much from the Forest Manager. Another seva I love is the Gaushala where we have so many cows who are all rescued cows. Feeding and brushing them just brings me so much joy! We shower them with love and care so that we can take away any memory of abuse in their past. Other sevas could include kitchen hygiene and cooking meals for the community where we all sit at the kitchen table chatting away as we help the chef. The meals are completely unprocessed, vegan food that will make you crave for a second and also third serving! After breakfast, we choose sevas that help with the general upkeep of the community, like accomodation, compound, toilet cleaning etc till it's lunch time. Afternoons are mostly relaxed and we hang out with friends, attend fun workshops to learn new things or go for a dip in the amazing mud pool. I personally love to curl up in the hammocks and read for a bit till it's 4:00 pm and delicious vegan tea and laddo is served at our tea hut! I have changed for the better and my life will never be the same again. I will always have Sadhana Forest in my heart wherever life may take me. I urge everyone to pay a visit to understand kinder ways to exist on this planet which is our only home.\n\nRead less",

        "review_content": "Alternative Life in Nature\nWhen I first arrived in Sadhana Forest, I knew I was in for a truly unique experience. I have been curious about learning more about sustainable living and veganism, Sadhana Forest felt like the best place to be. This is my first time living in a community and it has been amazing staying with like-minded people who are very open and accepting.\nMy journey at Sadhana Forest began as a fellow for Plant4India, a program that focuses on water conservation and reforestation in different villages in India. Through Plant4India training and forest sevas, I learned how to understand the land, dig trenches, make mounds, and plant trees. The experience was very grounding and I felt really good working with the community in the forest.\nThe dedication of the community to sustainable living is truly inspiring, and I experienced it through the compost toilets, hand washing stations, zero waste bins, and the huts (and many more). Walking through the lush greenery, I could feel the harmony between humans and the environment. The passion and care that the community pours into nurturing the land is a powerful reminder of the impact we can have when we prioritize the Earth.\nSadhana Forest is a place for anyone who is seeking a closer connection with nature and a path toward personal growth. If you are someone who is looking for an escape from the hustles of the city, I definitely recommend Sadhana Forest as it offers peace and a unique way of living. Life here moves at a different pace, I loved waking up to the soothing sounds of nature, feeling a deep sense of peace I hadn't experienced in a long time.\n\nRead less",

I resonate with the community\u2019s values a lot, veganism gets supported, there\u2019s lots of love for animals. Core values are compassion, unschooling, giving, seva and so much more. During the sevas we had lots of fun and I enjoyed the forest and goshala the most. Every day I had the chance to decide which seva I\u2019d like to do. I felt very respected as a human being and enjoyed all the different workshops (sharing circle, non talent show, etc)",

I got all these and many more, I served my minimum period of 4 days and going back feels like I'm leaving home.\n\nI'm so grateful for this place because I'm taking back with me so much more than I could ever even imagine.

        "review_content": "Beam of hope\nThe commitment to prioritise low-impact living practices, implementing off-grid systems, vegan gaushala, dry composting toilets, and solar energy solutions is what initially drew me towards Sadhana Forest. After coming here, I realised it\u2019s completely true.\n\nI wanted to be a part of a collective action where I can be reminded every day, that together we can make a difference in restoring and preserving the ecosystems; and Sadhana Forest fulfilled that for me.\n\nThe most beautiful thing here to experience was a sense of being in a family. Having support from volunteers, from all around the world, who have come together and share their experiences, values and skills. It\u2019s amazing how I got to learn so many things, through different perspectives & approaches while doing sevas.\n\nHere, people accept you the way you are, without any judgments or willingness to change you. I never felt I had to put a mask on here, and try to blend in this community; I was able to be real and raw and also experience others as humans first.\n\nWorking in a vegan gaushala, cow sanctuary, was a unique experience. From learning their traumatic past experiences about how they have been rescued; to earning their trust and knowing they can communicate with you, be it in any language. They know their names, and will come to you as you call them. I assumed it would be difficult and a very long process to build a connection with all the cows and bulls, but talking to them gently, giving them space and loving them is the key I learnt.\n\nRead less",

        "review_content": "Mind opening experience\nApr 2023\nI heard about this place a long time ago, and was finally able to come volunteer a few months ago. I was expecting a lot, and yet I wasn't prepared for all that I experienced here.\n\nThe most incredible thing about this place in my opinion is the community. Living with people who all share the same values, are here for each other in the most compassionate way possible, and all striving for the same purpose is the one thing that was truly missing from my life before. Being independant is not a requirement in this life. Being able to rely on a small group of people, live with them, share anything with them and know that whatever happens, they will accept me for who I am is actually so much better. The concept of gift economy was also something that made me see the world in a different way. Giving to others without expecting anything in return, knowing that everything in this life is available in abundance and using that abundance to spread as much love as possible. That's something I never even thought about before, so stuck was I in our current system.\n\nThe second best thing is nature. Living here is not living in nature, it is being a part of nature, just as much as any other animal living in this forest. You can directly see the consequences of every action. Washing your hands? It waters the trees next to it too. Same for washing the dishes or showering. Cooking and eating? Anything that would be thrown away is given to the dogs, cows or composted. And all of it makes the forest greener, denser and full of life. We are nature, and nature is all around us.\n\nI would recommend this place to every single human being on Earth. Some of it could be hard to get used to for some people, but the positives are so overwhelmingly amazing that stepping out of your comfort zone to come here would be worth it. Simply a life changing experience.\n\nRead less",

Growth Is a corner stone of Sadhana Forest.\n\nPersonally, the city life just got too overwhelming and I needed a space to escape to which would allow me to self reflect and grow. This community, their ideology, and my interactions with like minded people and the forest itself really helped facilitate this.\n\nTo be a part of nature in such an intrinsic way, and to give back to the community and forest felt transformative - the metamorphosis I so desperately wanted seems so much more tangible now.\n\nApart from the self development, to really feel part of a community (even within the short span I was here) and work towards something so much bigger feels really fulfilling and nourishing to the soul.\nBeing an architecture student I feel so much more confident applying the sustainable techniques that I learnt during my stay in my practices.\n\nComing here was a truly transformative process for me and I would urge everyone to visit at least once in their life.\n\nRead less",

Outside of seva, I get my own free time to be explore my interests. I also got the first-hand experience in helping take care of the forest and animals, like the cows and dogs here.

It's a dynamic community centered around compassion and sustainability that expands and contracts all the time. But the friendship and comradery are always constant. It is a place where the east meets the west in perfect harmony. I left my country 44 years ago, and this is the closest I have come to \"home.\" The hardest part is saying goodbye to friends.\n\nSleeping huts are comfortable and rustic. Made of all natural material. My first impression was Robinson Crusoe's hut. Waking up to the sound of birds is the best part.\n\nThe food is great. Plant based whole food. Just my style. The breakfasts are heavenly with so many different types of fruit. Other meals are a mix of internal cuisine depending on the lead cook. No one goes hungry here. Most people socialize during meals. I usually eat mindfully in silence.\n\nGoshala is a unique experience.\n\"The place of cows.\" Every cow and bull has their own personality. It can get exciting at times, especially around meal times. Most of them love to be brushed. They actually show you the part that they need brushed. And tell you when they don't like something or when they're done.\n\nThe tea hut is the most amazing place. The ambiance is great. It reminds me of the old west. The servers are awesome, too. I jokingly refer to the pair as the cute bar girl and the boundaries. A place to unwind and socialize.\n\nRead less",

We have a LOT of take aways definitely to implement in our daily lives. It just lit my conscious a bit more and I feel a lot of blanks got filled up. Being an unschooling family, a community like this, I had always been looking for. I am glad my daughter found a home in nature with a wonderful caring and conscious living community.

        "review_content": "Life in the forest\nI have learned a huge amount after spending several weeks in the forest and I believe my life has been changed, in big and small ways, because of it.\n\nTo start with the big things, I learned, firstly, what it means to function as part of a collective. Everyone works together in selfless service to maintain the community and grow the forest. The result is that no matter how much I give, I always feel like I recieve more. Additionally, I discovered a model for living which doesn't cost the planet. I thought I was already environmentally conscious as a vegan who avoids excess consumption etc. But until coming to Sadhana, I didn't consider the impact of my toilet, my hand and clothes washing facilities, my meal choices, and so much more. (Or if I did consider them, I didn't believe I could implement them as I didn't have a model of people who were living this sustainably). I will not be able to continue many of my pre-Sadhana lifestyle choices that are taken as a given in England.\nMoreover, the story of Sadhana Forest generally inspires me in life. It's hard for me to believe that this thriving community was once just 1 family, and the huge forest was once barren land. Experiecing the impact of a small group of people who wanted to create change gives me hope. Also, knowing this first hand gives me more confidence in myself to do bold actions than if I read about it.\nI could go on, but I'll end the 'big things' here.\n\nIn terms of smaller things: I've made deep and rich connections, I've gained tons of creative food recipes, I've met all sorts of wonderful forest animals, I've developed lots of budding interests from workshops offered by volunteers, I've become much physically and mentally healthier, I've learned about reforestation.\n\nThank you Sadhana :)\n\nRead less",

They are doing their best to create a wholesome way of life, in harmony with all humans, animals and plants! Anybody is welcome to volunteer year round.

The community life is very nourishing and enriching. You live, work and hang out and have fun together with people from all over the world. There are daily social activities.\n\nSadhana Forest is built on very strong values, trying to realize a conscious lifestyle: substance free living, veganism, zero waste, non-competition, unschooling... I never encountered any place that combined so many of these powerful tools that help us overcome our discriminating mind, and push us to live a life that is inclusive towards all forms of life!

        "review_content": "Transformative, pioneering community project, with a little bit of everything\nSadhana forest is a vegan community based on a few very human principles. In my personal opinion, this is a great suggestion for how humans can live and thrive together.\n\nIn a humanity that's growing constantly, trying to expand, explore, function, improve, I felt the need to leave the everyday bustle of Copenhagen in Denmark to go try something different. I initially wanted to volunteer at this place because of the reforestation that they are doing, but when I got into the rhythm of this place, observed and partook, I started to realize how much more there was to do here; to learn here! This community is more than a reforestation project. This place is booning with humanity. Not the humanity I was used to from back home, where everyone always has a million things they need to do, and even more things that they want to do but can't because of all the stress they put themselves/are put under in modern society. This humanity was closer to what I consider the core of us.\nHere, we practice gift-economy. Not just in the exchange of things do we want nothing in return, but also in exchange of favours, actions, a hand here or there. It's about being together about it, helping eachother out, not trying to earn your rent. We even have a free-store where we can drop off clothes we don't need and take whatever we do need, and a library where we can lend books free of charge.\nWe take care of eachother. When we get sick, we tend to eachother, bring food and spend time making sure nobody is ever lonely.\nWe eat together - all of us - and eat only vegan, for the sake of the animals, the planet and ourselves. We are also raw-diet friendly. The founder, who lives here with his family, eats a raw diet.\n\nPromoting this compassionate way of thinking and being is being highlighted even more as a big part of my life while being here. Probably also due to the wonderful people who come here. That's what this place is, after all - a collective, family, tribe, whatever you wanna call it - and it is only because of us that it remains and still functions after 16 years.\nIf you also want to try another way of living, a way that focuses on giving, enjoying, helping eachother out, appreciating beauty in the human, nature, and the relationship between the two, come to sadhana forest and live with us!\n\nRead less",

It is so amazing to wake up to the beautiful singing of the birds amidst nature, getting to know people from all over the world and support a project which is not only turning a desert into a forest again, but has also a lot of positive impact on the local Indian community. Sadhana Forest supports a non competitive environment, in which everybody can explore their own talents and preferences and even present them at the \"non-talent show\" once a week. Being over 40 my minimum stay would have been only two nights, but I will definitely stay longer. If you love nature and community life, I highly recommend to come to Sadhana Forest!\n\nRead less",

Where you also learn how to take care about the forest and the animals. Moreover it's a beautiful place with huts and a mud pool.\nTo be more precise, here I feel that there is a real community life because we do lots of activities together and we really work for the community and not for ourselves. The place has also a deep soul which is easy to get close to, so I could feel very fastly integrated. Even if there are lots of rules, which are necessary for the community life but it took time for me to understand some of them, it's possible to get involved and have responsibilities very easily. Moreover I feel that I learn lots of things everyday thanks to the people here and I still have enough time for myself which is necessary. The sharing here takes place with all the generations, from children to aged people, and with different animals like cats, dogs and cows. Ok my free time I really love staying but it's also easy and nice to go sometimes to Auroville which takes like 15min by motorbike.\nEven if the place is very clean and well organized, there are still the usual discomforts of mosquitoes and bad smells of the compost toilets. But this is part of living close to nature and being respectful of it.\nFinally, here you really never get bored thanks to the library, the workshops volunteers propose, the WiFi connection, the work for the community, the visitors who come daily and the rich nature around. The food here is also amazing, it's a great place to experience your relationship with it.\n\nRead less",

The fact that around 15 years ago there was only dust and now everything is green instantly gave me hope and inspired me in such a positive and powerful way.\nI definitely knew from this moment on: \u201eyepp - i\u2018m definitely in. I want to volunteer here.\u201c\n\nI quickly understood that here I\u2018m able to find a great way to grow personally and learn so many things about myself and others. About nature and our life.\nNow - after 3 weeks of volunteering I can definitely confirm this.\n\nHere you have the space to really put a mirror infront of you and to deeply reflect on your own personality and the world and what it means to live life in a community. Therefore it is also in fact a social experience. You are surrounded by so many open-minded people. You can easily talk to anybody about your emotions or what ever you\u2018re struggling or thinking about at the moment.\nI had so many great conversations with people here. Important conversations.\nI\u2018m so thankful for this time and experience here and will always carry this with me.\n\nI can only encourage everybody to go and visit this place.

Me, a young, energetic guy who is always seeking for new adventures to get me out of my comfort zone, made my way to india to look for that place. Out in the forest close to Auroville there is this magical community with even more magical ambitions: making the world a better place!\nSo how is this exactly working?\nBy reforestation, veganism and zero waste (especially focusing on water)\n, we are trying to raise awareness to our impact on the environment.\nMe, who went vegetarian half a year ago, has no problem adapting to the vegan food, which even offers a way larger variety to what I normally eat. Being in this community definitely helps to overcome any kind of issue and makes you feel at home, even though you are at the other side of the world. There are always people who look out for you and are giving you a heart warming feeling (the morning hugs are definitely helping).\nFor me, this is a place of knowledge and to find myself what I really want to do in life. If you are struggling with that as much as I do, then you should definitely go to Sadhana and get a clear head.\nHope to inspire you and raise awareness of a really beautiful place on Earth:)\n\nRead less",

As for the sustainability portion of the trip, we were given the opportunity to spend a week here in Sadhana forest. To keep it brief, I'm going to summarize the pros and cons of our stay here.\n\nPROS:\n- extremely welcoming and kind community\n- great (vegan) food\n- secular community\n- daily free workshops ranging from improv to yoga to salsa dancing\n- close to Pondicherry and Auroville in case you want to explore surrounding cities\n- great way to expose yourself to what a truly sustainable community looks like\n- very unique and life changing experience as a whole\n\nCONS:\n- the weather is hot and dry, and they don't have AC\n- schedule can be rigid such as waking up early to work around the compound and needing to be on time to meals\n- only compost toilets, biodegradable toiletries, and non-processed foods\n- bugs and critters such as dogs, cats, and cows\n\nHowever, if you are willing to put in the work and commit to a sustainable and higher-consciousness-focused lifestyle during your stay here, I highly recommend it.\n\nRead less",

        "review_content": "Beautiful experiment in Compassion!\nMay 2019\nI visited Sadhana Forest for the first time in 2013. I have since stayed at the project four separate times and have been volunteering here for more then a year now. Over my time here I have met thousands of people from around the world. I have come to deeply appreciate the uniqueness and opportunity of spaces like Sadhana Forest. The project is driven first and foremost by values. The idea is not that everyone should have the same values, but that by staying somewhere that seeks to practice every aspect of life with integrity and dedication that we in turn learn about ourselves. The ecological work being done in Sadhana Forest is fantastic and is evidenced by the absolute transformation of the land. What cannot be measured is the effect of bringing together people from all different backgrounds from all over the world to collaborate towards a common good will towards the planet, all of its inhabitants (including domesticated and wild animals!), and., of course, to ourselves and everyone around us. The effect is creating a place for growth, which is driven by heart and not scarcity and fear. Sadhana Forest is a beautiful place to cultivate hope in a world that desperately is searching for a reason to change and to fight for our values and our belief in a sustainable and nurturing world. Come give us a visit sometime!\n\nRead less",

Living this way, i feel im giving back to the nature, instead of just take and take, when there is no more to take from.\nWe also Do massive reforestation in the land surrounds as.\nThe voluteers are amazing people from all over the world, and everyone influences in their own special way.

Everyone is very welcoming and makes new volunteers feel at home immediately. Since Sadhana is located within the forest, it's provided me with the greatest since of peace and quiet I've experienced since coming to India. The community's goal is not only to live sustainably, but also to change the world through reforestation as well as education about lifestyle changes. Everyone staying in Sadhana works together to reach these goals and to keep the community running. On weekdays every member participates in two \"sevas\" before lunch, which are essential tasks that keep Sadhana functioning. The first seva that I participated in was helping to take care of the ten rescue cows that live on the property. The cows are very sweet and basically act like extremely large dogs. They will come push their heads against you as a way of showing affection, and many love to be brushed and pet. Sadhana Forest is a vegan community, and after spending time with the cows and having conversations with many other volunteers I began to question my choice to consume animal products. Although being at Sadhana did make me think about my lifestyle choices, I never felt any pressure from the people here to take on a vegan lifestyle outside of Sadhana. Despite not being vegan when I came to Sadhana I found all of the meals delicious and filling.\n\nRead less",

Therefore there is much to learn about all of it from the volunteers, the founder, the books...\nAnd I was much more than that living with the community for 6 weeks. Thanks to all this inpiring values and the inspiring people attracted by the place, I learned a lot on myself, being able to take some great decision for my life because I also finally had the time to work on them. It feels to me that I can live here an healthy, happy, stress less life while doing what is needed for the environment right now.\n\nSometimes, I feel like Sadhana forest is almost to beautiful to exist, and I would definitely recommend anybody that feel interested by it, to come and check it out.

I\u2019ve has the opportunity to visit Sadhana Forest a few times and each time I\u2019ve been grateful for the inspiration that comes with the experience here.\n\nSadhana is a conscious community, made up open people who are putting their beliefs into action to make the world a better, more compassionate place. They are also actively engaged in reforestation-to combat climate change and deforestation. A stay here will expose you to an alternative (or actually better, holistic, realistic way of living) way if living:vegan, zero waste and with compassion as a core value.\n\nThe impact of the place is in the practice. They don\u2019t need to preach, rather, by learning about the many detrimental effects of modern polluting industries, the answer seems clear. Also, it was through my stay here that I became more aware of my own consumption and it\u2019s detrimental effects on the environment. It would be hard to come here and not experience a perspective shift. And that\u2019s the beauty of it. Even after you leave here, the perspective shift stays: that there is an alternative way of living that doesn\u2019t harm the environment or it\u2019s living beings.\n\nI\u2019ve had the opportunity to share the Sadhana experience with college aged students, and for them the experience had been life changing as well. This is a place that will welcome all, and share the beauty of a compassionately lived life with anyone who walks through the doors.\n\nRead less",

In less than 24hr I got a warm reply from Victoria full of details on what their schedule looked like and telling me that they would be happy to have me any day! I couldn't believe it, next day in the morning I was there, sharing breakfast and helping in the second seva followed by lunch and a small (but exhaustive tour of the place given by Richard). In very few other occasions I felt so welcomed and part of something. What they are doing is truly amazing and it shows! Only amazing people are capable of such things. They live by what they preach and while helping mother Earth they are also really careful about the footprint we all have as individuals. Zero waste, intersectional, full of love and against every discrimination.\n\nLoved every second I was there!\n\nRead less",

It is not only a reforestation project, but a community with a lot of love, drive and creativity. This project signifies alternative ways of living, with sustainability and well-being of all life forms as a pervasive philosophy. The direct moral feedback of planting a tree, the spiritual satisfaction of selfless work, the purity of a vegan and sober culture, the wonderful people you get to know here. It all accounts to a peaceful state of mind. It\u2019s been a while since I felt so healthy and fulfilled.\n\nThe direct impact of reforesting 70 acres of endangered tropical forest in 16 years is huge, but even more significant is the inspiration that comes with it. Thousands of volunteers like myself stay here and learn, and tens of thousands more get inspired from visiting or learn through other channels. Sadhana is a movement, and I realise how important it is that more people hear about initiatives like this. Just being part of it is priceless and everyone is welcome.\n\nRead less",

        "review_content": "Reconnect with your self and your environment\nI heard about Sadhana Forest a while ago but I didn't really know what to expect and if I want to stay a month at one place. So I first came on the friday tour to have a look at it. The tour is offered by Sadhana Forest for free every friday. They pick you up and show you the whole place, explain you everything and are open for any questions. After this there is a eco - movie night followed by an amazing vegan dinner where you can connect with volunteers and get to know more about the personal experiences at Sadhana Forest. The tour really touched and inspired me so I had no doubts anymore and I decided at the same day: I definitely want to stay a month! I already felt that the place is spreading a really special energy, is following great values and offers you so much to learn. You experience that it is possible and even very enjoyable to live a zero waste live and not only this but even giving something back to the world by reforestation. Your personality can grow so much in this project not only by the sevas (selfless service instead of \"work\") but also by being part of this wonderful community. You live together with people from all over the world, everyone has a different background and different skills which are often shared with everyone interested by giving workshops.\nSo I came here to stay for 4 weeks and I love it. It is such a beautiful place with beautiful people. Everybody is taking care of each other you integrate very fast, learn so much from each other and about yourself and your doing something that is truly meaningful.\nIn Sadhana forest a giving economy is practiced which truly leads to happiness. Pure giving without expecting anything in return is wonderful, we do not need to fear that there will not be enough for ourselves or that we might lose anything by giving. There is enough for everyone and giving brings people together and creates happiness.\n\nI am very grateful to be here and be a part of the project now. I already feel how grounding this experience is. The vegan food is kind of healing your body, gives you more energy and increases your health, the sevas and the life in the community gives you the opportunity to reconnect with your core values and live aligned with them.\n\nIf you want to get an impression of Sandhana Forest I can truly recommend you the Friday tour but everybody is welcome to visit at any time. There will always be a volunteer to show you around and you are always welcome to join for breakfast, lunch or dinner and you can even try out the sevas. I am sure you will not regret it and maybe you even feel attracted to this place and want to stay longer.\n\nI am so grateful for this experience here realised by this amazing project and the wonderful people who support it. <3\n\nRead less",

No matter if you have 5 minutes or the whole day, Sadhana forest will greet you, give you a warm hug with its branches and stroke your soul with passion of people believing with their whole heart, that we can live peacefully and sustainably as a part of the nature. Sadhana forest is a place where people believe in true giving and they are happy to share with you delicious chai in Tea hut or any meal in the community, which is very family friendly and respectful towards children.\n\nI strongly recommend to join Friday tour, where you will have a chance to see the forest and learn about how the community works and about it's values (like unschooling, veganism, non-violence, zero-waste, etc.). You will have a chance to eat purely vegan food, scrape your plate with ash used for cooking and crown your visit using dry toilet that is at the same time designed to be used for nurturing the soil.\n\nYou can also come and become a part of Sadhana forest just for one day and see what is the place about. Breathe and laugh with the volunteers while planting trees, see and help with the community's daily life or swim in the mud pool (which is not only one of the greatest attractions for children of all age but also a way how to capture rain water).\n\nYou can simply come and let yourself be inspired by the place and you can be sure, that once you'll come out of the forest you will not be the same person, who walked in. You will take with you a little piece of loving kindness of the people, cows, trees, birds, dogs, cats, ants, bushes, butterflies and frogs living in Sadhana forest.\n\nRead less",

Came here not knowing what I was looking for or what exactly I was getting myself into. I've found more about myself in last few months that I've spent here than entire rest of my life. Truly life changing journey full of learning and growing and meeting so many amazing people, hearing their stories, receiving so much love. When people are loved for who they are, they heal. That's exactly how I feel. Sadhana forest will be my home forever no matter where I go.\nI've learnt the true meaning of compassion here. I realised being compassionate to my friends, family or people around me is not what compassion is while I pay money for animals to be butchered just so I can eat meat. I've spent all my life chasing the kind of happiness that fills my heart, finally I've felt that hole being filled by people's kindness towards each others, animals, environment. Sadhana forest for me is like opening a door to unknown and then finally realizing that should have opened this door long long time ago. Now, I know giving selflessly is what true happiness is. It brings you so much joy and satisfaction. I've made friends and family for life here in such short time.\nI've been here for almost 5 months now and have taken part in almost everything that's done here and it can only be described as amazing learning and growing experience. It can be challenging living with volunteers coming and going all the time but I've met so many kind, caring, loving, compassionate people here that it's my big crazy family now and I've learnt to accept every one for who they are and love and respect towards everything we do here.\nI believe if we can learn to be compassionate towards all beings and start putting same value to all living beings, we will automatically learn to be compassionate to each other as humans and we can stop all this unnecessary suffering of people, animals and the planet. We work so much better together than against each other. We can make a massive difference if we start putting compassion into everything we do.\n\nRead less",

It almost should be kept a top secret. But we like to share our abundance here...& the Mud Pool is a delight to share: refreshing, cool and warm in different spots and fun as can be! and like so much else here it has an intriguing history and sooo much went into making it.\n\nI love it here and find the long term volunteers, residents and staff here very welcoming. They are informed, passionate and committed to carrying out the vision and mission here. And the mission resonates with me - ( in my own words) to restore the water table, to reforest the once severely-dried and degraded land - and to eat vegan and live lighter on the land and on our own bodies with home made organic meals and no caffeine, processed foods, nor alcohol or smoke.\n\nPlus there\u2019s the founder\u2019s words about the living experiment here to \u201c engineer compassion.\u201d\n\nI recommend you check things out, take a tour if you can, and then come stay here at Sadhana Forest some amount of time to feel what it\u2019s like to be part of an ever-evolving successful international community.\n\nYou can jump right in to experience and help create a more sustainable, non- violent lifestyle and share this model of hope with the world. It is a happy thing to be at Sadhana forest, even if we have sad moments too. \ud83c\udf33\ud83e\udd17\n\nRead less",

Taking a mini tour with a mid term volunteer (main tour runs every Friday at 4pm) I got my bearings, enjoyed lunch with the community and felt incredibly welcomed - a home away from home.\n\nAfter lunch, I spent some more time exploring on my own, relaxing in the meditation hut and plunging into the mud pool. A beautiful evening followed consisting of dinner and an optional sharing circle for which I stayed having previously planned to leave mid afternoon. This magical forest had sunk its teeth in - I simply couldn\u2019t leave. The warmth of the local community blended with Sadhana Forest volunteers from further afield was refreshing and very welcoming - with all ages and a deep love for the environment and human connection, it had a strong family feel. With no money changing hands and not a donation box in sight, this is a beautiful example of the gift economy practiced here. This made it an easy decision to check-in the following day for a month.\n\nSo here I am, a week into my time here and loving every minute of it: practising seva (selfless service) each day - planting trees, cooking, cleaning and many more - demonstrating gift economy and living simply in a loving and inspiring community of people from all over the world. Impressed by its ethos and one of the most beautiful attractions in the Auroville area, this will always have a special place in my heart. After this initial month, I will almost certainly return and/or visit one of the other projects in Kenya and Haiti.\n\nRead less",

        "review_content": "A volunteering experience where you can help reforest the world.\nFirst and foremost Sadhana Forest is a reforestation project. It has been running for 17 years when it was once an arid barren landscape, and it is now a beautiful forest paradise full of birds, flowers, frogs, and volunteers from all over the world.\n\nThis is a powerful project which is addressing the climate emergency, and is putting compassion and ahimsa into action.\n\nBut is is much more than a forest - if you come and visit you will see the amazing main hut where all the volunteers eat three delicious free vegan meals a day and have eco film club on Fridays, the kitchen where all the food is made by volunteers, the huts where we sleep, the mudpool where we go swimming, the library full of free books... And a real sense of community.\n\nMost volunteers stay here for 4 weeks, some for a few months, and some for years. It is free to stay at Sadhana Forest, and there is a small daily contribution for food for those who can afford it.\n\nIf you want to come and find out more about volunteering here, come along for a free vegan meal! Either 8.45am, 12.45pm, or dinner at 6.00pm. You can talk to the long term volunteers about the incredible work which Sadhana Forest is doing to change the world for the better.\n\nCome and be a part of this wonderful part of the world.\n\nRead less",

Everything's well organised and planned, be it the ambience or how it works overall.\nYou encounter animals every now and then, the good part being that you can play with them.

Our guide held a fiery speech at each stop ouf our guided tour (about issues like compost toilets, unschooling, sanctuary for abused cows and planting tree saplings in a dry ground), then we got a free concert and free meal, all on the declared grounds of gift economy.\nWe got the impression that volunteers are happy there and that it is a community that really works and even has the capacity to receive guests every day.

And in the end i gained so much by giving a part from me away. People supporting me, Helping each other, living simple and compassionate lives. You think its not possible or too hard? You should come and visit. You will be surprised.\nThere are many options here to learn about permaculture, animal care, veganism, unschooling, gifteconomy and more. By experience or by Workshops and talks.\nI learned how to care for the cows in the sancturary and deeply fell in love with these beings. Come and cuddle some cows:)\nAnd I have to add: the food is amazing and jumping in the mudpool is the best.\nIts a great place for people all ages and backgrounds.

        "review_content": "Sadhana forest: Heaven on Earth\nI recently volunteered at Sadhana forest and without a doubt I can say that this place influences your life in many small ways.\nThis place helped me to change the way I look at things and to become a more responsible human towards the mother Earth. It made me aware of many small actions and how they can create an impact towards a better living.\nApart from all these things, Sadhana is place to have fun and interact with people of various nationalities. Just by listening to people's story you get to know about the things that you wouldn't have ever thought you'll learn.\nThere are various fun nights as well, so there's Non-Talent show where many people perform or make the audience perform and it's just too much fun to be a part of such activity and then every Friday they host eco film night.\nThere's not a single moment where you'll feel bored or left out. Everybody at Sadhana is very welcoming and considerate and they make sure you're having fun in the community.\nAnd not just fun but this place also heals you mentally and makes you a strong being. Every Wednesday they have sharing circle where you can share about anything and everything and there's no judgement,no feedback and no opinions, just pure non-judgemental sharing to let anything that's struck inside you to come out.\nAnd the best part according to me at Sadhana forest is the mudpool. Swimming in the swimming pool is too mainstream and nothing mainstream happens at Sadhana, So they've a mudpool and the mud is really good for your hair and skin. There were days where I would apply mud on my face and hair and just relax and have a sunbath.\nThis place is not just for volunteers but for everybody, even if you're around pondi or auroville, you can just pay a visit and have a meal over there. And trust me, food here is really really good and healthy.\nI'll highly recommend everyone to visit sadhana atleast once to try this alternative and lovely form of living and you'll see a change in yourself.\n\nRead less",

It\u2019s a transformative experience that not only gives me the break I need from the city but also recharges my whole being inside out. The core values of SF such as compassion, unschooling, gift economy, non-competitiveness deeply resonate with my heart. The seeds which were planted in me long ago finally received more nutritions and water to grow.\n\nThough community living may not be something we are used to anymore, it is truly rewarding to grow deeper connection with people from all over the world. Collaboration during seva(selfless service) is a great way to connect & get to know someone. My favourite activities are tree planting and cooking for 60+ people. Each week there are core value talk, sharing circle, non-talent show, eco film club plus many other workshops offered by different people staying here.\n\nIf you happen to be in Auroville, should definitely come check out Sadhana Forest. Swing by to have a free meal, join a seva, or even stay for an extensive time to get a full experience of this remarkable community!\n\nRead less",

It is a volunteer opportunity where you also live as part of a very special community. It is a perfect place to work on your own sadhana, and there is a lot of support for anyone who wants it. Volunteers come together three times a day to share a healthy vegan meal, and this fosters a strong sense of community and unity.\nThere are occasional workshops & events... yoga, non violent communication, Tai Chi, sharing circles, etc. The founders and long term volunteers at Sadhana Forest are passionate about the ethos behind the place and you will learn a lot during your stay. There is an inspiring weekly Q&A session with the founder, Aviram.\n\nWork is from 6am until 12 noon, with a break for breakfast. There are many options for work: you can go into the forest to assist with the reforestation work or take on one of many support tasks around the community.\nOne of the many excellent things about this place is that all toilets are dry compost toilets - no water is wasted unnecessarily. Some people may take a few days to adjust to the no-frills living.\nThere is a weekly tour on Fridays at 4.30pm followed by a film and meal - ideal if you are unsure about staying but would like to look around and learn more!\n\nRead less",

If you are expecting extremely basic or dirty living conditions, however, you might be pleasantly surprised. There\u2019s a very regular cleaning schedule, handwash stations everywhere, and even WiFi in the main hut. (Segregated to one area, so if you\u2019d prefer to take a break from technology, you have that option as well). Another big bonus is the food, which is abundant, fresh, and delicious. It\u2019s a vegan community, so expect a lot of fresh fruit, rice, dals, and many creative vegetable dishes. Lots of bananas, too - if you are hungry in between meals, there\u2019s a banana cupboard in the kitchen you can take from at any time.\nThe best way to understand the community here is by experience. Sadhana is a very love-filled, compassion-driven space. It\u2019s a place to feel free in your thoughts and actions, and able to grow at your own pace, in your own time. Sadhana is a drug and alcohol-free space, which makes it an extremely positive environment for anyone looking to try out a substance-free lifestyle.\nAs a fairly introverted person, I was concerned that living in such an intense community would challenge my need for alone time. However, I\u2019ve found there\u2019s many opportunities for quiet space throughout the day, and many places within the forest itself to take a break from group activities. When I\u2019m not playing music or chatting with other people, I\u2019ll often go for a swim in the mud pool, take a bird-watching walk in the forest, or take a short bicycle ride into Auroville.\nSadhana Forest is an excellent place for anyone to volunteer, whether you are new to India, looking to experience a sustainable lifestyle, or interested in exploring the values of the organization.\n\nRead less",

        "review_content": "\"Let there be more forests to grow people\"\nMy partner and I visited Sadhana forest for just a few days, which is more than enough time to come away with something special.\nThroughout our stay we interacted with many local and foreign people from all over the world sharing the same vision and ideas of how we should live as a community, how we should treat our own bodies, and how we should look after our planet. As a reforestation project you can connect with the forest and learn how the ecosystem works. It also touches subjects on un-schooling, gift economy, animal rescue and water conservation.\nWe especially enjoyed the Q&A with Aviram (the founder) who enlightened us across these various subjects, especially Veganism, and the journey of the project.\nIt can be challenging but is without a doubt a very rewarding experience, living this very minimalistic/basic lifestyle.\nAdjusting to the vegan diet was not a problem as the meals were plentiful and nutritious.\nThe living conditions are comfortable, if there was any concerns the volunteering staff were very eager to assist!\nSadhana Forest is a short distance from Auroville (20 min bike ride) where we could enjoy an array of amazing veggie/vegan restaurants, as well as not being far from the beach and Pondicherry city.\nIf you are wanting an experience like no other in India, I encourage you to come join Sadhana (phone or email or simply turn up unannounced, everyone is catered for!) Either to visit for their Friday Tour, or stay and volunteer. My favourite quote: \"let there be more forests to grow people\"\nThank you for everything and see you again!\n\nRead less",

I had come there to spend a month but ended up living for three months. And today I call it my second home. You are in the middle of mother nature, adding more love to the surroundings. Seeing so many different bird species, traces of snakes, porcupines and many more on muddy pathways, breathing fresh air, not being surrounded by walls, having green everywhere; these are only a few of the details among many things beautiful about Sadhana Forest. They practice reforestation, water conservation, community living, gift economy, veganism to name a few. It is your inner Sadhana which happens once you are exposed to the world of hope and compassion Sadhana Forest is. You get the best food here, and the understanding of minimal living. I have made some very beautiful bonds in Sadhana Forest. It changed me, in the biggest possible way. It made me more human and taught me to love myself and others without expectations.\nTo sum up, you must visit this place if anything mentioned above is of even little bit of interest to you...\n\"May there be many forests to grow humans\"\n\nRead less",

It is a reforestation project that is in the process of rehabilitating an indigenous ecosystem on the verge of collapse. They are also deeply engaged with the lcoal villages around - a community centre was set up at Sadhana Forest to serve the local villagers delicious vegan tea made from coconut milk. The water conservation measures have also profoundly benefited the neighbouring villages. You can stop by for a meal, tea, delightful conversations or just a tour and all of this is offered as a gift! No charge involved for visitors and the people are ever so friendly and helpful. It's hard to resist such joyous celebration of unity, hope and compassion. The Friday tour is expansive and ends in a delectable vegan meal and is highly recommended! There are many organisations that make promises regarding reforestation but Sadhana Forest walks the talk by not only planting trees but wholly remodelling people's lives and their relationship with Nature. And all this, with smiles!\nAre you looking to immerse yourself, even for a few hours, in Nature? Sadhana Forest is the place to discover yourself and your connection to the world around you - people, animals and the planet itself!\n\nRead less",

I have never been to a place where every member of the community (even if you\u2019re here just a few hours) is equally valued and appreciated. I particularly enjoyed the Saturday \u2018potluck\u2019, where everyone is welcome to join and enjoy a lovely meal in a gorgeous sunny setting.

People of all ages and cultures live here long and short term, so you will always find people to relate and talk to. I have loved getting to know so many people and sharing in such a unique experience.\n\nWhether you are just passing through for a quick stop visit or looking for somewhere more long term to stay, I would definitely recommend visiting Sadhanna forest for the delicious food, astonishing setting, friendly people and the totally fascinating way of living and feeling.\n\nRead less",

I knew it was a reforestation project and a vegan community but I soon found out that it was much more than that. Sadhana Forest is a community of compassion, of like-minded people from all backgrounds who share the dream of a better world and are figuring out how to realise it. It didn't take me long to commit completely to the all the sevas (selfless service) and to the values of this place and by doing so, I learnt and grew so much. Their main focus lies on reforestation and water conservation and those are taken very seriously, as they should be. But besides that there is a strong sense of community that bonds it all together, from morning to sharing circles. It's such a safe, non-judgemental environment where everybody is valued for what they can and want to give and not for how they perform in doing so. I had an unforgettable experience, had some of the best conversations of my life with the most amazing people and gained so much knowledge about alternative and sustainable ways of doing things. I'm taking with me so many \"seeds\" from this wonderful forests that grows people.\n\nRead less",

        "review_content": "Our Transformation in Sadhana Forest\nWe started unschooling our son Neel 2 years back in 2017, and in 2019 we have decided to travel with him. It is a sort of learning while travelling. The first name that came in our mind is the name of Sadhana Forest- a community in 70 acres of jungle - wow sounds interesting. Actually we have heard about sadhana forest from one of our family friends who stayed in Sadhana forest for 5 years.\n\nWe reached Sadhana forest in July 2019. We reached in the evening during dinner time and were welcomed by nearly 50 volunteers from different parts of the world. Let me tell u genuinely, the first day was a bit difficult. We have never been to community places like these and hence not used to staying with so many unknown people from different backgrounds, different cultures, and different languages. Also, life in the jungle is not easy, especially for us who are living in a Metro city like Mumbai.\n\nLots of initial discomforts - less electricity, hot weather, etc. Me and my son wanted to run away from this place immediately and we had decided to leave this place the next day.\n\nYorit comes to our rescue. Yorit is Aviram's wife (Aviram is the founder of Sadhana forest). She had a nice and fruitful discussion with us and suggested us to spend at least a week here so as to get the feel of this place. She suggested we accept these initial discomforts as a challenge and try to overcome them. Discussion with Yorit gave us courage and we decided to be here for one week.\n\nOnce we have took the decision to stay here for one week, we observed that slowly, slowly, all these initial discomforts vanished, and from the 4th day onward, we all have started liking this place and we have extended our stay by one week more. Today it's more than one month and we are still in Sadhana forest.\n\nWhat should I say about sadhana forest ? It's a heaven on earth. Nature at its best. It's a home away from home with a very loving and compassionate family. I feel blessed to be a part of this family.\nThe best part of my long stay here is knowing Aviram, Yorit, his wife, and two lovely daughters Osher and Shalev.\n\nI was amazed to know that Aviram is from Isreal. He came to India, fell in love with India , decided to settle in India , and completely shifted to India. He has acquired 70 acres of barren land which was like desert and transformed this barren land in to a jungle. It is a very inspiring life journey of Aviram and his family.\n\nAnother best part is the way natural resources like water and electricity are used here. For me it's a life changing experience.\n\nMy nine year son Neel is in love with this place. I feel Sadhana forest is the best platform for a Natural learner like him. He is basically from a vernacular medium but during the last one month his english speaking has dramatically improved. Earlier he was a little bit shy of a person but now he is very confident and has mixed with people very easily.\n\nI think sadhana forest is a must visit place for every one . Anyone visiting sadhana forest should know that this is not a Resort and should spend at least 2 weeks here .\n\nRead less",

So I came back this August to stay for at least one year with my daughter Dora.\n\nI have to say Sadhana Forest is such a wonderful place for children. This is a place where children are appreciated, respected and nourished. They have the opportunity to be exposed to nature and learn naturally, without being pressured. They will eat the healthiest food and unhealthy food cannot even be found here. I can see how Dora has enjoyed her living here. She has become friends with all of the other children from different countries and they can always find something interesting to do in the forest or the huts. She\u2019s been given so much love from all the volunteers in the community. I really appreciate it very much!\n\nRead less",

First, the place is very beautiful and peacefully. The Main Hut (and the otherd huts) is incredible. Also, the people are very nice and caring. There are a lot of good vibes here!\nJust one thing: you need to be comfortable to wake up earlier ... because we start our Seva at 6:00 am! But don\u2019t worry, you will awake with some music, and the Sevas are very nice (particularly when you are going into the forest to plant some trees!).\nThere are also a lot of activities: you can go to the mud pool, meditation hut, tea hut or just play music with somebody at the NON-talent show.\nAnyway, i recomand this place to all the nature lovers who want to share some good moments with everybody !\n\nRead less",

I learned a lot of things about how to plant trees, the life in community, recycling, how to live without waste. There are a lot of very cool activies with people from all around the world.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to recap my visit, the ambiance of the place, so come to Sadhana Forest !!

From the first minute I got there, people were eager to help me and show me around. It is a great chance for solo travelers, couples, friends and families to live in an open minded community with solid core values and principles. You\u2019ll never feel alone here.\n\nAt the beginning of the week we choose our sevas for the upcoming days, which means we get to decide what we want to do. Nobody will ever push you to do something you don\u2019t want. I myself worked in the reforestation group (planting trees, picking up wood, mulching), I took care of the cows, I worked with wood, I cleaned the kitchen, washed the solar panels and went to pick up fruit and vegetables in the vibrant Pondicherry\u2019s market.\n\nOther than these beautiful activities, I had free time in the afternoons and in the weekend to explore Auroville, to swim in the mud pool or read on the hammock.\n\nHow not to mention the delicious vegan food we had three times a day, prepared by the volunteers themselves. And the night activities, social gatherings to stay together in the Indian nights.\n\nI\u2019m grateful for all the people that I met here and I sincerely hope to get back or to visit the projects in Kenya and Haiti.\n\nRead less",

The location Can\nBe reached by bike,motorcycle car and tuc tuc and is close to food and Auroville amenities. In Sadhana\u2019s hits you would have all the peace and the relaxing sound from the forest as well as naturally fresh interiors.\n\nSadhana is a vegan community devoted to offer very yummy lunches, breakfasts and dinners. There are many events, including open intellectual talks on interesting social topics where you can learn a lot from others experiences and prospectives.\nOther events include, talent shows, music, open pot luck food night, tea shop and film night.\n\nSleeping is Sadhana requires a commitment of 2 days for Indian people and 2 weeks for Foreigners. To become a volunteer means doing two selfless services for the community, yes this includes tree planting, you can attend them as a GUEST if you are interesed on saturdays workshops.\n\nI strongly suggest coming at lunch time to Sadhana or doing the tour and having dinner at Friday.\nIs a special place where very concilia and lovely people live. You won\u2019t easily find other similar pure and interesting place.\n\nEnjoy the forest!\n\nRead less",

The place is an almost self sustaining community that has been focusing on giving back to the nature, for we are always in its debt.\nI was at Sadhana today (29 May 2019), for the first time, after years of failed planning. I was and am still astonished about how carefully each and every day-to-day activity is planned in this community.\nI am inspired by them for working towards improving the lifestyle of all the living creatures. The planning that has gone into usage of water, consumption of food and disposal of waste amongst many others is the need of the hour in today's world.\nUnfortunately, I couldn't participate in the activities except the tour because of my time crunch but I definitely hope to return for a longer stay.\nSadhana is not just a place to experience the bliss of nature, but is a way of life.\nIt's a must visit place if you're visiting Pondicherry and Auroville. The volunteers are an energetic bunch and are very jovial with their visitors. Kudos to Sadhana and its volunteers for all their efforts! \ud83e\udd18\n\nRead less",

Not only did the community (or Family I'd rather say) offer so much support that it made it easy quit smoking and drinking - but they also introduced me to the delicious world of veganism. As someone who has always had a problem with eating, I went from eating very little, to have 3 large meals with fruit snacks inbetween every day, and feel amazing for it!!\nI've learned so much about the world, the benefits of veganism both for health and ethically, about unschooling, the water crisis, gift economy, and the importance of zero waste. It's not just a reforestation project, it's so much more!\nI never expected to receive so much education in such a short space of time by so many interesting passionate people from around the world.\nThe living conditions are very basic which is perfect for the environment you're in, I found it very easy to adjust to.\nI definitely recommend doing the \"Eco Film Club\" on Fridays if you do not have time to volunteer. In just a few hours you learn so much about the project and can take a lot away for yourself, as well as enjoying some delicious vegan food!\nIt has been extremely rewarding and I look forward to returning in the future.\n\nRead less",

It's being inspired by dozens of crazy stories from long terms or new volunteers. It's discovering Auroville one afternoon here and there.\n\nSadhana, it's living in the forest, with the forest. Listening singing birds and biting mosquitoes. It's observing green shades and smelling wood parfume and bristle in the hut.\n\nSadhana, it's getting your energy level on maximum through contact with people, and with a project that makes sense. It's confronting yourself with a very unusual lifestyle, so healthier. It's living veganism, unschooling, gift economy and compassion. It's being forced to think about the future we want to live.\n\nI have stayed there 27 days. Enough to get deep into it, develop friendship. Not enough to be bored. Everyday has surprised me, i enjoyed every moment.\n\nThis place fits my personality. Sevas, including some for the environment, and some optional workshops and activities. Mostly a lot of time with people to share and meet, deeply and in awareness. I would not stay longer for 3 reasons. First, because my journey is about new places all the time. About leaving for other discoveries. Secondly because there is a bit too many people to feel at home very long. It takes me effort to meet and especially remember peoples life. Finally because if one day i participate in creating a place like this, i want it to be in Belgium or France, not other side of the world. It makes more sense for me.\n\nSadhana Forest changed me. I will never forget it. I keep deep in my mind and heart a part of this fabulous place. This community where magic of the environment is as great as the people staying there.\n\nRead less",

I am disabled and spent three weeks over the New Year with my mobility scooter living in a hut in the forest amongst the kindest and most compassionate people I have ever met. What a fantastic start to 2019 with each day bringing something completely new and exciting. Various evening talks on core values such as \u2018veganism\u2019, \u2018gift economy\u2019 and \u2018unschooling\u2019 brought about profound changes within me, especially as I am a school teacher! I found the \u2018sharing circle\u2019 to be surprisingly liberating and empowering. Despite my limited contribution due to my chronic health condition I was made to feel that I had a valuable role inspiring others with my determined approach within this non-judgemental community. Sadhana Forest was a culturally and emotionally immersive experience that has completely altered my mind-set. I have returned to the UK with a \u2018can-do\u2019 attitude, feeling so much more positive about my own future and the future of our planet which has been taken for granted. I would love to be in a position to return to this truly special and unique environment to see in 2020!\n\nRead less",

Sadhana is such a peaceful and soothing place - being in the middle of a forest simply calms you down. I am amazed by what they have achieved over the years and how energetically they still keep going and engage everyone around them.\nThe sevas I did were lots of fun and a great opportunity to get to know everyone from this diverse community better. And then the food - their vegan kitchen is just incredible, i enjoyed every meal, so you should definitely not miss out on that!\nBut lastly, the community I met there and got to be part of was something I will never forget - they way I was welcomed there and made to feel at home was very unique.\nSo, if you'd like to learn more about sustainable living in a great community - don't miss a chance to visit Sadhana or volunteer there :)\n\nRead less",

I began visiting the project mainly because I believe that the ecological work being done there is important. Many projects plant food forests but few focus there resources on preserving ecosystems that are threatened by extinction. Seeing the utter transformation of the land over the past 14 years is stunning, but while it is easy to recognize the ecological work being done at Sadhana it is the community work that has really stuck with me over the years. The community structure provides a safe space for families and solo travelers alike to experience powerful growth, friendship, learning and spiritual growth. The substance free policies, clean vegan food, and commitment to non-violence give people space to reimagine the way that they wish to live their life and the values that they hold most dear. I am grateful for the existence of this project because I know that I will always have a home there and a playground for exploring self and building my extended family and community around the world. I cannot recommend taking the time to volunteer here more highly.\n\nRead less",

It's an immersive journey with an educational movie-viewing - (normally pertaining to some environmental issue, we saw 'The Cove', and it isn't for the weak of stomach) - and of course, a fully vegan meal. So if you're interested in getting a true taste of Auroville, this is definitely a wonderful place to begin.",

        "review_content": "If there is one place to see in Auroville, it's Sadhana Forest!\nSadhana Forest is a reforestation and water conservation project, run by volunteers. 14 years ago a family startet this project in the middle of nowhere. Today you find a beautiful forest with thousands of birds. But there is still a lot to do. More trees need to be planted, the younger trees need to be watered and mulched and huge holes have to be dug, to keep the monsoon water on the dry land. But water conservation is not only about digging holes-it's also about using less water for washing hands and for flushing the toilets. Sadhana is also a beautiful vegan community which supports all volunteers. 2018 was my first time at Sadhana Forest, but for sure not my last time. Thank you Sadhana for letting me grow trees and also my personality.\n\nRead less",

        "review_content": "A place to live with nature\nI think the 10 days at Sadhana Forest were more like learning about the art of life than an ordinary experience. Nature is not a place to visit, It\u2019s home. The article caught my eye. A place where people live as part of nature, it gave me a new sense of the fact that humans are a part of nature and are connected to nature, and it was a wonderful time where I could completely focus on the present moment.\nI gained a lot of positive motivation while living in the forest in a community with various people from all over the world. We were able to volunteer together and learn a lot about various cultures. Selfless Service While doing Seba, I was able to notice myself changing every day, and I was able to feel more deeply that not only humans but all living beings have emotions and that each and every one of them is precious.\n\nHere, we take direct action in our daily lives in a way that causes as little harm to nature as possible. Dry toilets that don't flush, amazing alternative ways to shower, wash your hands and wash dishes with ashes while saving water. Soap and shampoo are also used as ecologically biodegradable products. People with bright energy who try to live as human beings who are part of nature gather here.\nAfter experiencing the vegan lifestyle for 10 days, I gained a new perspective and a lot of interest in what it means to be vegan and not getting anything from animals. I think I will miss the healthy diet of fruits and vegetables that I ate here.\n\nIn addition, any community member can create various workshops such as yoga, meditation, dance, and sound bath, and the space to share talents is open at any time.\nAs I slept in a cabin with no fans or lights, and used a bathroom with a view of the sky and stars, I gradually got used to the feelings that were unfamiliar and uncomfortable at first. The power to accept many things has increased.\n\nSanada Forest is a time of meditation where you can look at every moment with new eyes, and I think you can make positive changes to yourself and to many people just by coming here.\n\nRead less\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle",

        "review_content": "A school where I learn about myself through forests and nature\nWe are a Korean couple volunteering at Sadhana Forest. There don't seem to be many reviews here in Korean, so I'm leaving a post because I thought it would be helpful.\n\nfirst of all! I think it would be good if I could tell you what kind of place Sadhana Forest is. It is a place that is difficult to define in one word, but I think it is a place where people who love forests and nature gather. It is also a space of practice where you can learn about others and get to know yourself better, and at the same time find answers.\n\nAll of the people gathered here are volunteers. I have seen people staying for as short as 4 days, 10 days, and as long as 7 years. I wake up at 5:30 in the morning, do seva (selfless service) for about 5 hours in the morning, and spend my time freely in the afternoon. There are various community events where discussions and talent shows are held. Anyone with talent can hold a workshop and share it.\n\nThe lifestyle is very nature-friendly. All meals are prepared vegan. Urine and faeces are treated with fertilizer, shampoo and toothpaste are all natural, and dishwashing is done with ash from a fire, not with pong. Individuals under 40 years old live in dormitories, while people over 40 years old or couples live in independent cabins. There is not even a common ceiling fan in the cabin. Electricity use is only possible when the sun rises. It seems like an unfamiliar environment for Koreans. You have to pay 600 rupees per person per day to the community, including all meals and accommodation. (Exemption for long-term volunteers)\n\nPeople seem to gather here for their own reasons. Some people come to Sadhana Forest out of passion for the forest, others out of hope for the vegan community, and still others out of simple curiosity. We came because we were curious about Auroville, a spiritual community, and especially Sadhana Forest, a community that lives a vegan lifestyle while tending the forest.\n\nI have never been vegan or vegetarian. While talking with many friends here, I was able to think about the environment, animal rights, unschooling, and a way of life that could be an alternative to capitalism. Rather than simply a place to plant trees and take care of the forest, I think it serves as a school that teaches the importance of nature.\n\nIf you are tired of life and feeling disconnected from nature, if you are wondering if it is really right to live like this, or if there is a different way to live, it would be a good idea to come to Sadhana Forest and sweat together to find the answer.\n\nRead less\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle",

        "review_content": "Experience beyond words\nToday is the ninth day in Sadhana Forest. I am getting more and more accustomed to living in the forest, feeling comfortable and calm. I mentioned to a friend a while ago that I was about to travel to India and I would fly to the city of Chennai. He mentioned Auroville to me and he thought I would like this area. He mentioned Sadhana Forest in particular and decided to go to India. The first stop was Sadhana Forest. I also wanted to experience life in a volunteer based community.\nThis is my first experience of living with a community. We have different tasks that require division of labor every day. We will get up early together, cook, clean, go to the forest to water... and so on. As long as the forest needs help, we all need help. We'll all do it together. In Sadhana you will meet friends from all over the world, just like a big family, and you will get to know everyone easily. There are different tasks every day, you will seva (selfless service) with different people, and you will also have various activities. You can participate in various workshops and activities. After the afternoon seva, you can go out and explore the surroundings, or you can enjoy the quietness and comfort in the forest. There is a mud pool if you want to soak in the water, and a library if you want to read a book. Books, meditation hut. If you want a quiet little space, you can meditate, do yoga or sleep. I occasionally walk to the Tea hut to have a cup of coconut milk chai. I really enjoyed my time in the forest, and the time will slip away unconsciously and you won't realize it. Whether you want to meet new friends, learn about their forest restoration methods, or experience group life, come to Sadhana Forest. It will be an unforgettable memory. Thank you Sadhana Forest!\n\nRead less\nGoogle",

I have never found a place where values are learned and lived that are so close to my ideal idea of living together and are consistent. So many things are combined, from the way of life, the food to the way we treat each other. People from all over the world meet and are welcome.\nIt is important to know that a stay here (or living here - for those who are interested) is not to be confused with a vacation. Physical work, rules and a predetermined structure are part of the whole. This can be very exhausting and a little disappointing for some who need more creative freedom. But if you are open and get involved in life here, you quickly get used to the lifestyle and routines.\nI particularly like the forest, where I go for walks almost during the day. The many birds...the sun...the lake where you can swim.\nI can only recommend everyone to come here and have this experience. Even if you don't want to live a lifestyle like this, you take so much home with you.\n\nRead less\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle",

It is not easy to lose one's original intention and continue for a long time. However, I think it is very meaningful that so many people are coming and going for such a long time without losing their original intention.\nI like the daily structure of doing seva in the morning and doing free time and various community activities in the afternoon. I think it is a sustainable way to steadily realize the original purpose of Sadhana step by step, while having the opportunity to meet a variety of people.\nAt first, I was a little embarrassed by the hard and strict restraints, but as time went by, I began to understand why these rules were in place.\nAlthough there are long-term volunteers, the majority stay for 8 to 20 days, or at most 6 months to a year, so I am worried about what to do to truly form a village and live in this way.\n\nOn a typical trip, you can't interact with this many people. I think that's the biggest charm of this place. Even if you're not fluent in English, let's sweat and work together and share our hearts.\n\nRead less\n\n\nGoogle",
