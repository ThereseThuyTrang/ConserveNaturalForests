Overall they have created an amazing atmosphere and make you feel right at home immediately.\n\nThe forest itself is beautiful and the history is very interesting. I learnt about the issues of deforestation in Thailand and the government/NGO initiatives to reverse this trend. CNF have re-introduced a wide variety of tree species to restore a thriving eco-system to land that was being abused by farmers\n\nKamee the elephant is definitely the highlight for me! So nice to see her in her natural environment, roaming free and not being used as a slave for tourism like in other elephant shelters. She comes and goes as she pleases, and turns up for her afternoon snack at the end of the tour.\n\nI would highly recommend visiting this fantastic experience!",

However, being a part of this amazing team and witnessing the amazing work they do has taught me so much more than just the basics of this topic. I gained a lot of knowledge about the forestry problem that Thailand faces as well as the various strategies this organization has implemented to contribute to the solution. This organization is indeed working very hard to restore the ecosystems of once-healthy and intact forests. After ten years, the results of the reforestation work done by this organization on plantation grounds are already spectacular, demonstrating the potency of their Framework Species Method replanting technique. Not only have I enhanced my understanding of the various environmental issues that touch this country, but I have also gained significant insights into the diverse range of solutions that exist. Being a part of this NGO's work has truly been an honor, allowing me to contribute and learn in meaningful ways.",

If you\u2019re interested in visiting a sanctuary but questioning the ethics of each one, then this is the one for you. Miguel has created an example of what a non profit conservation park can be. Everything you could be doing, he is doing. From creating fertiliser out of elephant/cow poo to hiring ethnic minorities and paying them more than a living wage to planting 300-400 thousand trees a year. He has mangrove, coral and sea grass restoration projects beginning which is exciting! The experience was amazing, we were shown the process of fertiliser making, mushroom farm and lots of endangered plants. The interns here teach local school children and give them food. Their beautiful elephant Cami is being allowed to roam free in preparation for hopefully being released into a national park. We had organic passionfruit g&t\u2019s on the house and snacks as we watched the elephant have hers. This is a gem for nature/wildlife/conservation lovers. If you want an ethical, local conservation project then come here!!! Your money is worth every cent!!",

Hippo, our tour guide, described the organization\u2019s reforestation efforts in Pai. She discussed how the land used to be garlic and soy farm, but ever since the organization started planting lots of different trees, it's since turned into a rich, biodiverse forest. We saw a lot of butterflies and birds, and Hippo said sometimes there are monkeys.\n\nWe also visited a lot of different spots. They have a butterfly garden, a mushroom house, and a botanic garden. Then we walked through the demonstration forest, where Hippo explained the different trees they've planted. We also prepared papaya tree seedlings for planting. People can donate to the organization to offset their carbon footprint since the organization uses the funds to plant more trees.\n\nNear the end, they gave us passion fruit drinks while we watched their elephant Kamee roam around. You could tell she was really well taken care of! It was fun watching her enjoy the bananas, her afternoon snack. This is a good place to see an elephant ethically\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the tour. Hippo and the other staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We could tell they care a lot about the project.",

If you are also big on sustainability, CNF is also the place to go. They will teach you about certain plants and berries that you can and can\u2019t eat in the area all while taking a beautiful hike in the vast forest in Pai. After foraging, you can try the freshest water that you can drink which the guides had set up using bamboo tubes from a small creek. All the guides really know what they were doing, they were all great in making sure you knew how to do some something if you were unsure. Our leaders Carly and Dan were great in answering all our questions as well as teaching us everything to know about CNF and the wildlife around us.

We visited the project site and the team there seem to be doing brilliantly in terms of reforestation, wildlife conservation and education. We learnt about the process of planting a tree from it being a seed through to the germination process to actually planting a tree ourselves. We absolutely felt like we was taking the right steps to offset our carbon footprint.\nThe project site is in such a beautiful location with a lush river running right through making it a great location for Kamee the Elephant to live a healthy and happy life in an environment that seems to be perfect for elephants. We got to follow Kamee around in her natural habitat which was amazing while sipping on a refreshing passion fruit gin and tonic watching Kamee eat and forage for herself.

She comes and goes as she pleases, and is eating constantly! On our trip she was constantly near by while we learned about elephants in Thailand, reforestation, and other community initiatives. Very different from an elephant show, ride or photo op - in my opinion much better, as it felt like we got to spend time with her, on her own terms.

Having spent time at other elephant 'sanctuaries' I can vouch that this place really is ethical... All your interaction with Kamee is on her timetable and is for her benefit, not yours so no washing and and mud baths, just you feeding her some banana and passionfruits, which is funny to watch.\n\nFinished off with a delicious passionfruit mojito it was a really lovely afternoon.",

The day starts by riding in the back of a pick up to a beautiful location outside Pai. We are met by a friendly employee (spacing her name) who provides a history and goals of the preserve. She made a comment that she knows why everyone is here not to learn about the trees but to see the elephant, but I felt like it was super interested so I wouldnt make that assumption in the future and appreciated all the info on the fauna of the area!\n\nThe time with the elephant was super chill and genuine. Really well cared for elephant and they don't turn the whole thing into a selfi-taking petting zoo which is quite refreshing. You spend 2ish hours feeding the elephant and watching it hang out. The day ends with planting seeds/saplings, seeing their mini turtle sanctuary and drinking a wonderful cocktail by the river.\n\nHighly recommend for a chill day in the jungle that respects the elephant on site.",

Visiting Conserve Natural Forests is a great way to spend an afternoon while in Pai.\n\nThe tour went like this. They picked us up in town and drove us all to their conservatory which is about 15 minutes outside of town. At the conservatory, a woman named Hippo taught us about Conserve Natural Forests and their efforts to work with the local people to help reforest Northern Thailand.\n\nThen we got to meet and feed their elephant named Kamee. They explained Kamee was there to help fertilizes the land and was not there for our entertainment. We were allowed to feed Kamee and take pictures. However, no one was allowed to ride her. I could see from my own experiences visiting so-called elephant sanctuaries that Kamee was extremely well taken care of and looked very healthy. I guess that\u2019s because Conserve Natural Forests is not an elephant sanctuary but a reforestation NGO.\n\nAfter that, they took us to their tree nursery to teach us more about reforestation in Northern Thailand and how we can off set our own CO2 emissions by planting trees. Which I thought was very interesting seeing as my carbon foot print had grown by just flying to Thailand.\n\nEveryone got to participate in the planting of tree seeds and a chance to plant your own sapling. This was followed by an opportunity to ask more questions while enjoying a beverage. I would 100% recommend visiting these guys",

We must respect it, we must allow it to roam, eat, swim, relax and do as it pleases.\nThe people who run this amazing organisation, headed by the outrageously funny Migel, demonstrate every day that they are serious about rehabilitation of animals and the forrest. It shows in everything they do.\nWe had a quick discussion about trees and why planting them makes so much difference to the eco system we are rejuvenating. Also the science of elephant poop and its phenomenal effect on plant growth.\nThen we got to pick out plants, dig a hole, name ours and cement or contribution in the ground forever.\nPeople talk about conservation but who is willing to support it? Who is willing to put thier money where thier mouth is? Who is willing to contribute their time and to put the needs of the animals before our own desire for entertainment or photo ops.\nLunch and drinks were available which were both cheap and delicious. The atmosphere is very relaxed and there's a placed you can sit and chill while you take it all in. You should allow as much time as you can to visit as you wont want to leave. It's only open for a few hours a day to allow the elephant to spend most of her time in her natural environment and away from humans.\nIts possible to arrange a pick up from Pai if you don't have your own transport. If you have a scooter its pretty easy to find (quite a nice ride).\nOnce you have visited Conserve Natural Forrests once, you can go back any time for free. They encourage you to come back, plant more trees and reconnect with nature and recommit to changing the future one elephant at a time.\n\nRead more",

        "review_content": "Dream come true!!\nWhile travelling through Thailand a couple of years ago, I had already decided that I would not see any elephants as I was hyper aware of their unethical treatment that plagues Thailand. HOWEVER, after making anew friends in Pai, they told me about this magical place that has reduced a mother/daughter duo of elephants who happened to be pregnant at the time. Once we arrived, after crossing a very small river and getting a little wet, all of the elephants scratches and feeding awaited us. This was my dream come true! After giving them all the snacks, the owners's partner offers amazing Thai dishes that are beyond memorable! So be ready to eat! This experience was one of the best moments I had while travelling in S.E.A for 6 months.\n\nP.S this place is an eco sanctuary and farm so you get the opportunity to plant a little tree and leave beyond a positive impact while you're one your travels.",

She was so happy when se cames out to see us. She felt very comfortable with us and looks very healthy.\n\nBut it isn't only about the elephant. We planted trees, which is beautiful and extremely important for the world to plant more trees and keep it green! If you want to do something good for the environment, if you're traveling in Thailand, visit this place.

Being someone who Is very much against animals being used as entertainment or for profit, I was naturally very skeptical about seeing elephants in Thailand. I am 100% opposed to riding elephants and would not have gone to see them and donated if that was the case. The experience I had was something I will never forget. When I was there I met two beautiful and heavily pregnant elephants who were hanging out freely and playing in a little stream out in the forest. We spent house there (there was a very small group of us) feeding the elephants bananas. The two elephants seemed very content and happy and it was clear to me that these animals were living the best life they could and the owners of the conservation park had the purest intentions in doing what is right for them. It was truly a rare opportunity seeing and interacting with these animals ethically. I remember the guy working at the park (which was not gated or fenced of anything) to be knowledgeable, kind and gentle. He taught us how to plant trees and fully explained what he was hoping to achieve with the park. The fee at the time was a donation of our choice. I cant remember what I donated but I wish I could have given more.",

Unlike most elephant \u201csanctuaries\u201d, CNF is an elephant rehabilitation area that purchases abused and working elephants and reintroduces them into the jungle (national parks). Miguel and his team are also planting thousands of trees and helping other indigenous jungle animals! Miguel\u2019s passion for the project is infectious.\n\nA visit to CNF is incredibly educational and an amazing experience to see a wild elephant doing its own thing. You can feed Kami bananas and watch her, but she is by no means exploited like other elephant centers. CNF can pick you up and in Pai and drive you to their land, or you can get there by motorbike.\n\nI highly recommend cruising there on a motorbike, it\u2019s an easy beautiful ride through the countryside. Just don\u2019t drink too many of Miguel\u2019s famous passion fruit gin and tonics \ud83d\ude09 If you get there early enough, there are some natural super hot hot springs about 30 min further down the road worth visiting also.\n\nWe visited CNF three times during our Pai stay to spend time with Mama Kami and to talk with Miguel.

The CNF team are extremely knowledgable about both reforestation and wildlife conservation, and it's clear that the Pai community are proud to host such dedicated NPO in their town.\n\nWhile CNF isn't an elephant sanctuary per se, it is the best place in Northern Thailand to see an elephant up close and personal, and one of the only places I'd feel comfortable knowing the beautiful creature is being cared for as well as humanly possible - bordering on spoilt! There's a 1000THB minimum donation for entry, but this lets you come back as many times as you want, and it's a more than fair price for such an entertaining and informative afternoon.

They rescued a 33-year-old and heavily pregnant elephant, Kamee, from a logging company and they are habituating her to the wild before releasing her to the Casablanca Wildlife Reserve. Elephants and reforestation go hand in hand \u2013 wild elephants need habitat in which to thrive and forest growth is aided by elephant dung. Visitors have the opportunity to observe Kamee and feed her fruit & vegetables. Kamee is in charge \u2013 she stays for as long as she wants and is not compelled to do anything. There is no riding, bathing with or touching her as CNF is trying to reduce her contact with humans as much as possible. Visitors also get to help germinate seedlings for planting come rainy season. It is their goal to plant 1 million trees this year!\n\nThe tours run from 1:30 \u2013 5:00 and there is a 1000 baht minimum donation. They will pick you up and drop you off in Pai. If you wish, Hippo will make you a spectacular lunch and Miguel will mix you a passion-fruit gin and tonic. It\u2019s a lovely way to spend an afternoon, learn about conservation, interact with an elephant in an ethical way and contribute to the restoration of Northern Thailand\u2019s forest (and offset your carbon footprint!).

Our guide Jason was just fantastic- very knowledgeable and passionate.

Returning elephants back to the forest is absolutely necessary to ensure the forests can recover from the damage caused by extensive logging for teak. I do hope that Kamee gives birth without problems and returns to an elephant tribe when she returns one day. Great work!!!",

With each potential stop I\u2019d look up the companies and find questionable reviews and opinions likening these sanctuaries to circuses so I decided it would be something I missed until I could see them in the wild one day. Then I found a recommendation for Conserve Natural Forests and only positive reviews. That\u2019s because this isn\u2019t a circus show but rehabilitation for the single elephant they can currently manage that they will release back into the wild once her baby is strong enough to make the journey. This isn\u2019t even the prime goal of the group, their primary objective is reforesting parts of Thailand with elephants being a integral part in that process (poop full of nutrients). The guides were kind and informative, and I really enjoyed my time with them and some like minded individuals during my visit and hope everyone considers this group if they want to see an elephant on their trip and support a worthy cause.",

Jason, our guide, was contagious with his eyes lit up with passion, telling us everything there is to know about elephants\u2019 life and about the sanctuary itself. These people are replanting the natural forest with their own hands and let you try and do the same: every guest gets to plant and name his own tree. Truly the best example of being the change you wish to see in the world. Kamee turned out to be very pregnant, 26 months - about to give birth any second. Despite having a whole entire elephant inside of her she keeps being very graceful and extremely cute. The place is worth spending a whole day there from early morning, it\u2019s beautiful and serene. I don\u2019t want to spoil more - go and see for yourself!\n\nThank you for your passion and hard work guys.\nVisit, relax, enjoy and remember!",

The activity happens with a lot of respect for Kamy, the pregnant elephant. The only interaction we have with her is feeding and observing her. The tour is very honest about the elephant tourism industry and answer every question. Wes is also an amazing guide to explain the project of reforestation, which we participate to by planting a tree at the end of the day. I recommand this tour to anyone who wants a respectful moment with elephant and wants to contribute to a magnificent project.",

The tour (and organisation) felt very genuine and I would recommend this to anyone seeking an authentic, up close and personal experience with an elephant.\n\nThanks to Jason, Miguel, Hippo, and team - you're all doing amazing things for the elephants and the environment. I'll be back to see you again for sure!\n\nP.S - those passionfruit gin and tonics are to die for!!",

        "review_content": "Best experience of my life\nThis place is incredible. I had no idea of the huge issue of elephant tourism that is present in Thailand. This organization takes it incredibly seriously and is determined to rehabilitate elephants for reintroduction back into the wild instead of using them as a tourist attraction. They are also attempting (and succeeding) at reforesting much of the greenery in the surrounding area. Every visitor that comes is encouraged to plant a tree in hopes that the enormously depleted forest will soon come back.\nThe staff is kind yet transparent. They don\u2019t shy away from the tough questions that sometimes have brutally honest answers. They really care there.\nThey also have a land tortoise sanctuary for rehabilitating and repopulating Thailand\u2019s endangered tortoises.\nI HIGHLY recommend a day trip to see Kamee the elephant and plant a tree. You give only a 1000 baht donation once, meaning that if you go back two days, two months or two years later, you don\u2019t have to pay again. PLEASE GO HERE",

        "review_content": "Amazing Project, Must Do in Pai\nI went to Conserve Natural Forests a few times when I was in Pai two years ago, and couldn\u2019t wait to take my mom when she was visiting. This is a very unique organization that is working to combat deforestation, one of the root issues for elephants & other wildlife in Thailand. It is very educational. You learn about deforestation, the history of working elephants in Thailand, & you get to see tortoises, an elephant, & plant a tree. Miguel, the owner/founder, his wife Hippo who makes great Thai food, and our tour guide Jason were all awesome. When we went they had one very pregnant elephant (due any time!), Kamee. Kamee is being rehabilitated so that she & her baby can eventually be released into a protected forest. There are no hooks, chains, bathing, or forcing her to do anything or go anywhere. Tours are small groups and they only have one a day so that she has minimal interactions with people throughout the day. You get to hang out with Kamee, feed her some snacks, & observe her do & go where she pleases while her mahouts & the staff are ensuring the safety & well being of Kamee and visitors. When we were there in December there was a family with young children, and our guide clearly explained potential hazards & guidelines and made sure the parents & kids understood before starting the tour. When one of the children started approaching the elephant from behind, Hippo noticed right away and immediately brought it to attention to ensure the child\u2019s safety. If you want to interact with elephants ethically, this is the only place to do it in my opinion. Even though other places advertise no riding, no hooks, etc, those elephants are still working all day every day & typically not treated well.",

The iniciator of the organization as well as all the staff have a huge knowledge about reforestation and elephants. They informed us, that there is not enough forest in thailand at the moment to set all captured elephants free. That\u00b4s why it is so important to invest in reforestation. They have a pregenant elephant named Camee there, which is in very good health. There is no riding, washing or touching allowed but you are able to feed Camee with bananas - se likes them peeled ;) she has all the freedom to walk around in the 80ha land and as soon as the baby is able to they will both be released into the wild.\nBesides the elephant and the dschungel, flowers, nature, it is a really lovely atmosphere there. They serve good and cheap food, passionfruit-gin and tonic and you can go for a swim in the river. They organize a truck from Pai, that brings you there and back to town.\nYou pay 1000 Bath and after that you can come back to this place whenever you want. I came back once and I will definitly go there again. Money is really good invested there :)",

I wanted to interact with Asian elephants in some way while in north Thailand but, having heard so many horror stories about so called sanctuary\u2019s I was looking for a place without riding or either bathing.\n\nConserve Natural Forests is focused on regenerating the forest in what was previous agricultural land. By creating a tree species rich environment, the aim is to increase biodiversity of surrounding national park forest. All visitors have the opportunity to plant a tree at the end of the visit to help with this aim.\n\nThe organisation also has a breeding programme for endangered tortoises, that have been rescued from being eaten. That will eventually be released to the wild.\n\nThe secret to a healthy forest is apparently elephant poo, and this is produced in great quality by Kamee who is also heavily pregnant. Visitors have the opportunity to interact with the elephant and help to feed its daily dose of bananas. It goes without saying that there is no riding or bathing involved\n\nThe owner and staff were all super passionate about what they do. Well worth a visit.",

The work they do here is fantastic!! The main focus is reforestation and supporting the eco system - each vistor will plant 1 tree at the end of the tour. We learnt so much during our time there about reducing carbon footprint, how many trees we need to cancel out or own emissions from our trip etc. The highlight of our trip was spending time with Kamee the elephant and seeing how well treated she is! The organisation work alongside other charities to rehabilitate their animals into the wild. (They also had some land tortoises which are going to be released shortly). We crossed the river and trekked through the forest to find Kamee - she is living as free as their land allows. She came across the river with us where we were able to feed her bananas and pumpkins. During this time she was still free to wander around us as we sat talking about elephant care and the work the organisation does - she is not caged, chained or locked up at any point and is cared for in the best way. She is currently 24 months pregnant and in a few years her and her baby are set to be rehabilitated into the wild. Wes was a fantastic tour leader and he was really informative!! The place also offers fresh cooked food and passionfruit gin and tonic - all just 50 baht each. All visitors pay 1000 baht but can return at any point and not pay the fee again! I cannot recommend this place enough.",

As Thailand have many so called \"sanctuary centers\" most of the are scams where elephants are rented and presented as rescued. This place was different. The elephant was rehabilitated to be released back into the wild. In other words were there no promises of tricks mudbaths, or other displays from the elephant. It stayed around as long as it felt like it (obviously it stayed as we gave it food) and hugging, kissing the elephant was discouraged. In other words, it was treated as an wild animal, with respect and sensibility. The care of the elephant was spotless!\nTheir main focus is reforestation (regrowing harvested forest) and they are quite good at it! They've even managed to bring back animal species that the locals thought were gone. We had the honor of being part of this process by planting a tree of our own (for free). The owner also made really good tropical gin & tonics that everyone enjoyed!\nAll in all I'd say that when it comes to genuine eco-tourism this is the real deal.",

At CNF I could learn about reforestation, wildlife rehabilitation and conservation.\n\nFirst, they will show and explain you their running project of the endangered tortoises. After that a detailed explanation about the endangered species of asian elephants will follow and make you aware of the problematics, which most of us didn\u2019t know. Currently they have one elephant named Kamee and its beautiful how they treat her. Kamee is free to do whatever she likes so she is not forced to do anything. This is a great way to show her the natural life of an elephant before releasing her into the national park!! It's not like other places where elephants are forced to entertain tourists. No riding, no forced bathing, no abusing, no chains. We just joined her with whatever she was feeling like doing. She looks really happy and healthy for sure!\n\nAnother big project they are working on is the reforestation. Their goal is to plant at least 1 Million trees a year! I also got to experience the project in first hand by planting a tree on my own. Since the tour is about 4 hours long, I had a lot of time asking the staff about their projects and about anything that crossed my mind. They are very kind and heartwarming people! And once you participate in a tour and donate, you can come back any time for free.\n\nI would recommend this place for people who want to experience and learn about nature the right way. :)",

The atmosphere is super relaxed and everybody is very nice and easy goiy. Still you immediately see the passion these people have for their project. If you have a question you can ask any time. We got the chance to ride in the back of a pickup truck, meet and feed a lovely elephant lady, learn a bit about the reforestation and wildlife conservation project, saw some turtles and planted some trees. All in all a wonderful afternoon! Thanks a lot! :)",

They have mostly 1 or 2 elephants saved from labour and abuse, and they learn the animals how to survive and live without humans. In the end they are released in a safe environment, completely free from humans. They also have projects with birds, frogs, turtles, but these projects depend on when you visit. Don't expect a show or forced interaction with the elephant. Normally the elephant always comes to eat bananas but they are free so they can come late or they can get sick of it after an hour and return to the jungle. This was the case for our visit, but it is such a great project we were happy to donate more than expected. If you hope for the best for the animals, this is the olace you should visit!",

        "review_content": "Unexpected circumstances, but wonderful experience still\nOn route with the pickup truck we found out that there was a forest fire around the site, and they informed us immediately that the day would not be a usual one. We thought of it as a special experience and took our chances, also to be there helping in any way we could. Their work focuses on caring for their elephant Kamee, and whatever happens, she and her wellbeing is their priority. So the \"usual\" activities that normally went on for the visiting donators (like us) would include feeding, bathing, and/or whatever else was on her schedule, meaning whatever she wanted to do. We were happy and honoured to be able to meet her, even though the circumstances almost didn't let us, and the staff at CNF gave us a lovely experience in the end.\nSome of the visitors in our group didn't understand the bigger picture when they were told that the time spent with Kamee had come to an end, which was sooner that usually. They reluctantly threw their one-time donation in the hands of the staff, and left complaining about the absurdity they had been forced to \"deal\" with. It was very disrespectful and sad to see that they couldn't realise that what they, and every visitor, gets to be part of when donating to CNF. You get to help improve the life of a majestic and gentle creature, plant trees, get inspired from and learn about the work being done by the staff at CNF. Not only that, but you also get to come back in the future if you'd like, no additional donation necessary.\nWe had a wonderful time, and we are happy to support them.",

In the future there will be more elephants but right now there is one, pregnant, elephant witch will except his young one in may this year.\n\nThen you will cross a river (water to your knees) to find the elephant and give her the candy's.... bananas!

It's all about the elephants and what they want to do, not about them doing what we want to do....I felt so blessed to find this place where all of the folks that joined us...except a couple older Germans who were, I guess expecting a circus act who were unhappy...but thankfully left....were there to share the same experience, and we had a wonderful afternoon of heart and love and sharing, eating fantastic food, drinks, swimming, feeding kilos and kilos of bananas to Kamee, and culminating it by planting trees, to contribute to the awesome work Miguel is doing.

If you only did one thing in Pai...\nThe elephant actually stayed after we finished feeding her banana to hang out with us. while chatting around the table she was enjoying her meal of cane grass but also coming over to sniff us out and say hi. You know she is loved here and that this is the real deal. Planting a palm tree at the end of the visit was very relaxing and took two minutes. I named my tree 'kasi suli' meaning strong plant in toki pona. They practice a special method of reforestation where they mix varieties of plants together instead of using a mono-culture. They also use the elephant poop as fertilizer so its a very synergistic holistic place. If you only do one thifng in Pai, this is obviously it. Miguel and Hippo you two are rockstars. To 1 Million trees!!!",

She\u2019s just like a human in that she is moody with her pregnancy but VERY VERY well looked after with her own playground and treated very well. No riding!! You do what she wants to do!\nHippo & Miguel are fantastic hosts and you come away feeling blessed with this experience. Due to the fact there is only one elephant, it feels very intimate. You get informed on deforestation and plant your own tree which is a nice way of rounding up the day! I will return if I come back to Pai and will follow on Facebook for the birth of the baby elephant! Thank you for the wonderful experience. A highlight of my trip thus far!!",

        "review_content": "This is the place you've been looking for!\nThe first time I visited CNF was in January. I had spent the better part of a month looking for a place where I could feel comfortable interacting with elephants, with their own comfort and health and happiness assured. As soon as I got here, it felt right. The drive out was beautiful (but the road is snakes around quite a bit!), the valley was green and the river was just the right temperature, and that was all lovely and everything, but it was the passion and sincerity of the CNF team and the obvious contentment of the elephants that really sold me.\n\nNot only that, but they've done some outstanding work with their reforestation project. The eco-tour guide was friendly and informative, more than happy to answer all our questions after giving us a brief rundown of the project site. There's a definite sense of satisfaction when we planted trees at the end of the day, knowing that we can give a little back to the land we've taken so much from.\n\nCNF is quite different from other places where tourists can see elephants: they let their elephants roam where they want, eat when they want, and basically do their own thing. They stress that the elephants aren't here for us; we're here for them. It's that perspective that really makes a difference between here and the many other places with elephants that I researched. It felt like the elephants had invited us into their natural habitat rather than the other way around.\n\nAnd to top it all off, they have the best food and the best passionfruit gin & tonics in northern Thailand! Since my first visit, I've been back every time I'm in the area. Their new elephant Mae Kamee is simply lovely - sweet, calm, but with a certain spirit to her. Her personality really comes out when she's splashing around in the river. I can't recommend this place enough. They're doing amazing work, and they're doing it right. If you've been on the fence about elephant tourism but still want to interact with these astounding creatures, this is the spot for you.",

        "review_content": "Sustainable Travel, Relaxing Afternoon\nConserve Natural Forests is THE best way to experience elephants in Thailand. You can tell Kamee is treated with nothing but respect, and the emphasis is placed on her happiness, she is free to roam and eat as she pleases. Getting to feed her bananas is a blast! CNF not only helps in giving elephants a comfortable sanctuary, but they also make a huge positive impact with their reforestation project. When visiting, you get information about the project and get to plant a tree yourself, which contributes to the thousands of trees they plant per year. All in all, you will have a great afternoon relaxing, drinking delicious passionfruit gin and tonics, eating Hippo's authentic Thai food, feeding elephants, and learning more about what it truly means to be an \"eco\" tourist. Highly recommended!",

        "review_content": "Great time at CNF!\nCNF does a really great job on their project site in Pai, Thailand. The drive in is absolutely scenic as you wind through jungle foliage, pass rice paddies and garlic farms, and make your way toward the Pai River where this organization owns a beautiful plot of land. After arriving, me and the other guests I was with settled in while one of the interns went through a nice introduction of what CNF does; what they're all about. We learned about the reforestation efforts and some of the history of this NGO. The site boasts 30 species of plants in their demonstration forest and walking through it was really an experience in and of itself. You don't really know what to expect until you're right in the middle of the thing.\n\nBesides reforestation, this NGO has also acquired a female elephant, Cami, who we spent plenty of time with and fed bananas to. To see this elephant in a totally free setting where she could graze all day and make her own tracks through the land was really special. It's simply great to visit an organization that cares so much for this endangered animal, for the future of their species, and of course for a more sustainable future.\n\nAfter feeding Cami a number of bananas and spending time with her, we went back under the shade and enjoyed a passionfruit gin and tonic and some Pad Thai made by some amazing cooks, and then chilled out for awhile and lost track of time. Eventually a CNF intern took us back into the demonstration forest, where we concluded the day with a tree planting session. It was very fitting to say the least.",

It is a day spent with friends and people who truly care about the conservation of the environment. The elephants are Amazing, they are gentle giants, who are very easy to interact with. The secret to their hearts are lots of pumpkins. They will literally eat them all day. The people who work there are super nice and very passionate about what they do. Once you get tired of playing with the elephants you can enjoy fresh delicious Thai food as well as cold beverages. Stop by for a visit. It is truly a once in a lifetime experience.",

Since elephant nature park was fully booked, we decided to visit this establishment instead, and boy was it totally worth it. We got to feed and bathe two pregnant elephants in a small group of 12/15 people. Everyone was very respectful of the elephants and you could definitely see the respect the mahouts showed the elephants because they were not forced to do anything they didnt want to do. No riding elephants, no pulling on their ears, no yelling at them.\nIt was also eye-opening to hear that the sanctuary was initially started as a forest restoration project, which they continue to work on. Each one of the visitors gets to plant a tree to aid in the project. The staff (Miguel, Hippo, Zac, Do, and others) were very entertaining and informative, and I commend them for their commitment to a nobel cause. Definitely try Hippo's cooking (it was delicious) and Miguel's gin and tonics! The trek out to Conserve Natural Forests is worth it if you're in Chiang Mai! I hope to visit again in a few years to see how much my tree has grown and to see the baby elephants!",

I talked my husband into going with me and we requested a tour through the website. We met them in town and followed the vans to the area with our scooter. The afternoon was incredible, we got to feed the elephants (they eat a LOT of pumpkins) and help to give them a bath. Both of them are pregnant but one was VERY pregnant (4 months overdue at the time we visited). Afterward you got to order some home cooked noodle dishes from the chef (they are delish) and have a nice passion fruit gin and tonic. At the end you help to plant a tree and the entire time you're there they explain their mission to you. The environmental protection project, as they call it, is absolutely wonderful concept. They've planted over 150,000 trees last year and want to plant 200,000 this year.\nIt was our last day in Pai and a memorable way to spend it. Highly recommend you going to visit.",

        "review_content": "An important project with inspiring people\nAfter researching elephant centers and speaking with friends and travelers that have visited similar locations throughout Thailand, I decided to take a bus north from Chiang Mai to visit the hippie town of Pai for one reason: a trip to Conserve Natural Forests.\n\nWe were greeted by Miguel and Hippo, who explained the conservation to the group. They have spent years working on their projects, ranging from restoring biodiversity in the area to growing the populations of endangered animals. It was clear their team is passionate about wildlife, ecosystems, and making the world a better place. After a few safety tips and jokes, we were on our way to find the elephants.\n\nWe trekked with one of the mahouts - the \"security guards\" and \"elephant whisperers\" - for about five minutes through a beautiful stream and nature where we arrived at what appeared to be the corner of their property; just a few feet in front of me was the mother and daughter elephant grazing. Conserve Natural Forests was able to rescue these two beautiful mammals from a life of riding; the two were in paradise, 24/7 protection and visitors that had no intentions of harming them. They were free.\n\nIt was surreal to see a mother and her daughter, both pregnant, and both with a team constantly providing anything they could possibly desire: endless pumpkins, baths, and love. Each member of the group was able to feed them here and take countless photos with the two beauties.\n\nWe all walked together with the elephants back to the main spot, where we were able to feed and bath them. The experience was intimate and seemed to be the closest I could ever get to seeing elephants in the wild. For only 50 baht per meal, everyone was able to dine on delicious fresh food prepared by Hippo and her team. I have NEVER had Pad Thai that tasted this good.. I had to have a second plate :)\n\nThe experience was one I will never forget, and hope to return to Pai to visit the elephants with their new babies when they arrive. The travelers that recommended Conserve Natural Forests were not wrong; the world needs more people like Miguel and his team.",

You are given some pumpkin at the beginning and you walk across the river to the huge, heavily pregnant elephants to feed them. You then bathe the elephants in the river and spend the last hour feeding them again. The elephants are so happy and content, it was amazing to experience. The group was quite small (around 20 people) so everyone took it in turn to feed them and take photos. The staff were all lovely and the food was gorgeous and cheap. The organisation only require a small donation of minimum 500baht which goes towards the nature and welfare of the elephants. I would highly recommend a visit, we will definitely be back.",

We had an amazing fried rice dish with a nice cool drink, shot some slingshots and had all the time of the world with the elephants.

They sent all 20-25 of us to the elephants at the exact same time. This caused a lot of awkwardness and even anger as people fought for position for photos. Things got a little tense. They simply could bring smaller groups of 5-6 at a time across the river.\nThey do have pretty good food and drinks to enjoy as the elephants come to the river.\nIt just all felt like a bit of a money grab (I know they need it and believe it's going to a good cause). But we had that tourist conveyer belt feeling.\nIt also lasts too long. We were all more than ready to leave. And buy leave I mean in the back of a truck flying down the mountain side. I didn't mind this kind of transportation, but it's something some people should be aware of.\nIt's worth the 500 baht, but if you can drive or Motorbike yourself that would be best as you can leave when you like.",

Later, we got a chance to wash them in the river. In between these activities, I have also tried the great food and Gin & Tonic here, really worth trying.

After which, you will enjoy one of the most spectacular drives of your life, that is the road to this haven.\n\nYou might have encountered Elephants before but, even still, prepare to be in awe. There are no words I can find to give justice to what I felt. It\u2019s natural to feel initially overwhelmed by the Elephants but they have a charm and gentleness that will relax you. Before you know it, you will be closer than you can ever have imagined.\n\nBoth rescued Elephants are pregnant. The daughter is due any day, so not only can you see the baby calf silhouette around her body, you can also see it move and even feel it....it\u2019s unbelievable!!\n\nThe founders are a delightful couple with a team of passionate workers who are more like a family. Everyone is extremely friendly and hospitable. Hippo makes the most fantastic Thai food and, if you would like a beverage, then just sit back and enjoy a gin and tonic with Miguel.\n\nMoreover, the experience is very educational for those who are interested in conservation and those with children. You will learn not only about the Elephant rescue program but also about the primary goal of reforestation.\n\nThe day ends with the group joining together to plant trees that have been carefully selected by professional eco-graduates to best suit and thrive in a natural habitat. This is a wonderful opportunity to give something back and leave with the most heartwarming feeling from a day very well spent!! I can't wait to go back again & again!!!",

It is also quite an adventure to get to the place and back since they only have a pickup truck and only four people can sit in front and the others need to sit in the back and this can be funny if you have 13 people to fit in....\nLong text, short meaning: Go and enjoy an amazing day there!!!",

I swore I would never do anything like this again and would encourage others not to.\n\nI then started hearing so many good things about this project just outside of Pai called Conserve Natural Forest where they have two elephants roaming free on the land of their conservation project. It took me some time to visit but when I did I was delighted to see just how happy these big, beautiful ladies were! Both mother and daughter where both rescued from tourit camps and heavily pregnant\u2026 a marvel to see!\n\nThere is such a nice vibe at the centre between the project leaders, volunteers, mahouts and the Thai staff and you can see they all love the elephants like family\u2026. you can even see that the elephants are very aware of this and grateful for their new life.\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful way to spend an afternoon, hanging out with these majestic beasts, learning about conservation and leaving a good mark by planting some trees. Another plus is that the ride out there is wonderful with stunning views of the surrounding area of Pai. You can either jump in the pick-up truck or ride out behind the group on your own bike.\n\nConserve Natural Forests simply ask for a donation which goes directly back into funding this incredible project. And you must try the Gin and Tonics and delicious food from Hippo\u2019s Kitchen!\n\nHighly recommended as one of the things you must do when visiting Pai!",

Miguel rescued this mom and daughter elephant duo from a tourist facilitation where they were worked daily, and provided them land where they have learned how to be free elephants. Now they are both pregnant and will bring baby elephants into a harm-free world.\n\nWe also planted a couple of trees! We could purchase delicious food and drink. We learned much about the elephants and land. We bathed the elephants in the river. We were picked up near our hostel and dropped back off there at the end of the day. Also, those who give a donation are welcome back anytime free of charge. So great! Truly magical day. Please don't hesitate to support this organization.",

He has the elephants out of his pure love for the animal and his desire to help them as a species. Conserve Natural Forests is an amazing organization that hopes for nothing but to improve the natural environment of Thailand and the elephants who call it home! Very fun, cool way to interact with the animal. + One is about to give birth any day now!",

Both elephants (mother and daughter) were pregnant which is the whole idea...repopulation. They own the land, so the elephants can roam free and eat and bathe in the river. No pens, no chains, no riding or work. We got to feed them and get in the river with them and help these amazing creatures bathe. Lunch and drinks were provided for a nominal fee and we made a suggested donation of 500 BHT..so worth it. After hanging out with the elephants we were given three trees each to plant to help reforestation efforts which was awesome. They provided transportation from Pai for us and back as well. A MUST do while in Pai.",

Like many people who are wary of tourists traps, I was rightly skeptical of a lot of NGOs in Thailand but can honestly say I feel so lucky to have experienced such a genuinely amazing project. CNFs sole focus is to conserve wildlife and reforest Thailand the right way. Miguel, Hippo and the mahouts involved in the project are amazing. Upon arriving at the beautiful land you can see the fantastic methods of conservation being used all around you. Then suddenly you are greeted by two of the most beautiful and currently very pregnant mother and daughter elephants returing from frollicing in the protected mountain jungle. I have always been cautious of engaging in anything elephant related in Thailand and sadly thought i would never find a genuinely 100% ethical project until CNF. These rescued majestic beings are now completely free to live the life they should. No riding, controlling in any form, restraints or chains just free to do as they please, how it should be. Spend the afternoon feeding them, getting to know their adorable personalities and even bathing them in the river to cool off! Another fantastic moment at CNF was planting endangered tree species, seeing the protect the tortoise project and learning about the importance of correctly reforesting the sadly dwindling thai jungles. Not to mention Hippo does amazing food and Miguel makes a fantastic G&T or sangsom to enjoy in between the action. Simply a must! I cannot reccomend this experience highly enough. I never review on tripadvisor but had to take the time to write this review of the most brilliant NGO experience of my life!",

The aim of his NGO was to Conserve Natural Forests (as the name suggests!) but also to provide a beautiful, free and natural environment for rescued elephants to thrive in. Coming back to Pai and seeing that he's achieved this goal after so much hard work and perseverance, with the help of a small but dedicated team of interns, has been inspiring and a real highlight of my travels. Such an amazing experience I'll never forget. Big love to everyone involved. Looking forward to seeing how things develop with the organic farm, the birds and turtles, and when the little baby elephants arrive...\n\nGood people doing good things :)",

In a wonderful,,natural setting,,,Miguel and his workers offer you a chance to see and get up close to these beautiful elephants in their natural unspoilt habitat. Gone are the days of climbing on the backs of these stunning animals,,no chains,,no chairs. I have visited twice now,,,as you walk down to the river,,the loud bellowing trumpet can be heard,,,Miguel has 2 elephants,,both pregnant and rescued from a working enviroment,,, the elephants are in wonderful condition. The pair were bathing in the river,,,shoes off,,,straight in the river to get up close and personal with these stunning creatures,,,much splashing of water,,,commenced!!! The mahoots are such nice gentle fellows,,full of laughs and giggles... a small bamboo bar serves cold beer,,gin and tonics at cheap prices. Miguel is a genuinely interesting and lovely guy..full of information about the elephants and the conservation of these animals and the forest they live in..,, with long term plans to re plant trees to replenish the forest of surrounding areas,,this guy IS giving something back. After a few beers and good conversation, the elephants made their way towards us,,where bananas, corn etc were plentiful to be fed to the elephants...a truly magical experience. This is not a tourist attraction,,,it is a genunine working conserve. A relaxed atmosphere in a beautiful setting with lovely friendly people. No fees but a donation of money is required, the final activity was to plant a tree. Such a lovely afternoon,, I cannot recommend this enough. Please visit here rather than the elephant camps,,you come away feeling amazing. I have in the past gone to other elephant camps,,done the riding etc and came away feeling guilty and disgusted at the way the elephants are kept and used for our 'pleasure', this is not the case here. A totally different experience. This is one place I will visit over and over, happy just to sit and watch.",

He then went back again earlier this year and and saw how far the team had already come in those couple of years, saving mother and daughter elephants, both pregnant, from a life otherwise destined for tourist rides, and planting trees in the thousands now.\nAfter a change of travel plans I decided to come here and see what he was talking about, and as promised I had an incredible day with the team, eating Hippo's (the fab chef!) amazing food, finding out more about the environmental issues from Miguel, Stephan, Julie and Margo and feeding and bathing these 2 incredibly beautiful and insanely pregnant elephants!\nI told everyone I met in Pai they had to go there and went back twice more over the 2 weeks I stayed in Pai because I couldn't get enough of the elephants in this stunning natural environment and wanted to help the cause as much as I could.\n\nThere is a minimum donation of 500baht (which compared to other organised tourist elephant days is peanuts and not even comparable in terms of the experience) but if you can donate more this really is a worthy cause!\nThis covers food at the site and a ride in a truck to and from Om Garden (if you don't have a scooter, though the ride is stunning if you can do it), as well as spending as long as you want there feeding, bathing and chilling with the elephants.\nYou can also buy beers or G&Ts there for super cheap (and they're yummy!)\n\nOn my last visit there everyone planted at least 2 trees so you're also contributing to what will in five, ten, twenty years be an incredibly diverse forest and wildlife haven with hopefully lots more elephants roaming free and happy!\nI hope I can come back soon to see the progress and the babies!!",

The warmth that you get from these people is truly genuine. Their cooking and their gin and tonics are delicious as well.

However, we were very afraid of picking an organization that does not treat the animals well. A girl at SpicyPai recommended \"Conserve Natural Forests\" and we booked a visit for the next day. We got picked up at OmGarden, had a great ride to the place and were crazy happy once we got to see two pregnant elephants. They bought the animals off tourist organizations that maltreated them and it was great to see how happy the elephants were, living free in the protected environment. It was amazing to get to learn about the elephants and how elephants are usually kept in Thailand from people that really care about the animals' welfare. Of course it was also great to learn about the problem of deforestation in Thailand and to actually get to plant trees! We were both just smiling all afternoon. I also enjoyed a freshly cooked Pad Thai while observing the elephants. - Best experience we had in Thailand!",

I am happy that I visited them to get more information on elephants, the area they are in and just an overall education on helping the habitats of the elephants.\n\nI think that anyone that is up in the Pai area show their support for this great program!",

        "review_content": "Incredible experience, enjoying elephants in their environment\nSome backpackers told us to avoid the advertised elephants tours, because they do not respect elephants which are exploited and forced to work. This place is amazing, you simply have to give a free offer (minimum of 500 bahts) which is definitely worth the experience and goes into the support of the project. Best way to save money, support a great environmental project and enjoy elephants in their environment.",

        "review_content": "Amazing conservation in Pai\nThoroughly enjoyed my visit to Conserve Natural Forests - They have a great set up and are dedicated to the environment by restoring and maintaining not only their land but other places throughout the neighbouring towns which is refreshing to see.\nThere are a number of elephant conservations in Pai and Chiang Mai which I have never personally visited but have heard many things about, generally they are very touristic and overpriced starting at 2,500 baht for one day.\nWhat i loved about this organisation was that it was donation based, minimum of 500 baht but feel free to donate as much as you like but the groups are small and its a very personal experience, they don't rush you and give you plenty of time with the elephants to feed and bathe them.\nAlso you are able to give back to the environment by helping plant trees or pack seeds for their future reforestation projects.\n\nAt present they have two female elephants (mother and daughter) who are both pregnant, one being due any day now so if you visit you'll most likely get to see the baby :)\n\nVisitors are welcome every day and they pick/drop you off in the centre of town. time is 1-5pm and you need to book through the website or on their Facebook page!\n\nIf you are looking for a unique and genuine experience visit here and help them raise enough money to continue their amazing work!!",

It is honestly an amazing place with passionate individuals genuinely caring for the elephants and environment. If you have always wanted to spend some time with some elephants at a sustainable organisation, i highly recommend this place rather than the extremely commercialized ones in Chiang Mai, and I'm sure you'll have as much fun as I did. :)",

Everyone should visit and donate so they can rescue more elephants and make it a better place. You can feed them you can swim and Wash them in the river what makes this experience even more unforgetabble.",

Luckily we found this place, which is involved in much more than elephants.\n\nWe rode with our motorbikes from Pai following their truck. Once on site we were greeted by everyone, including the two pregnant elephants (due very soon, when rainy season is over) and they explained their whole project which we were all so happy to support. Afterwards, we fed them endless amounts of corn and bananas and went into the river to bathe them. We had the opportunity to spend time and know all about them. At the end, after having lunch, we each planted two trees.\n\nWe had the greatest time and everyone was so nice! I would definitely recommend coming here.",

We drove our bikes out about 18 km into the mountains on the most beautiful winding road. On arrival at the site we were introduced to the two female (pregnant) elephants, Kamjan and Maemoon. They have both come from tourist camps were they were ridden 8 hours a day, every day. Now, they don't ride anymore! They are free to wander the land of the project site, eat when, what and where they want to. We gave them additional fruit treats and were then invited to bath them in the river. The best bit is just to be given the chance to observe them and know that they suffer no more.\nAfter that the team at CNF explained to us their mission and goals for the future and what actions they are taking to help in the combat of deforestation, we planted a couple of trees on the land and helped in their organic garden.\nIt was such a special day, I won't be forgetting it anytime soon!",

After a 30 min drive through the mountainous forests of Northern Thailand we arrived at the project site. Greeted happily by Kamjan and Maemoon, the two pregnant elephants, that were obtained from tourist camps. The elephants look very content while just walking around, swimming and constantly eating. After our interaction with the elephants the CNF team explained the importance of forests and how to go about restoring tropical forests. We even planted a few trees and prepared some seedlings for next year's planting. Apart from the activities, the local chef, Hippo:), prepared us a delicious meal upon request. I highly recommend visiting Conserve Natural Forests.",
