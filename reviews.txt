A wonderful project - great for all ages.
Dec 2023 • Family
We went with children aged 6, 9 and 12 and they all had a fantastic time - as did their parents. If you're in Pai you should definitely take the time to visit.

Must go!!
Nov 2023 • Friends
Absolutely amazing experience. I learned so much about… so much. From biodiversity, to deforestation, to the reality of the life of elephants. This was a great experience. The team working there cares so much about what they do and it shows. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is coming through the area.

Amazing experience!
Nov 2023 • Solo
I stayed there for 1 month and it was incredible! I was a guide there for the tour during this month and I can guarantee you that it is a must to visit in Pai! All the projects they have carried out on the site are as interesting to see as they are to learn. It was a pleasure to have been able to contribute to this beautiful and great project!

Fantastic experience!
Nov 2023 • Solo
I visited this amazing organisation and was so impressed with their setup and mission that I decided to stay for one month and volunteer for them.

Miguel and Anchala are excellent and welcoming hosts, and the rest of the site staff are diligent and friendly. Overall they have created an amazing atmosphere and make you feel right at home immediately.

The forest itself is beautiful and the history is very interesting. I learnt about the issues of deforestation in Thailand and the government/NGO initiatives to reverse this trend. CNF have re-introduced a wide variety of tree species to restore a thriving eco-system to land that was being abused by farmers

Kamee the elephant is definitely the highlight for me! So nice to see her in her natural environment, roaming free and not being used as a slave for tourism like in other elephant shelters. She comes and goes as she pleases, and turns up for her afternoon snack at the end of the tour.

I would highly recommend visiting this fantastic experience!

Relaxing and interesting afternoon activity
Nov 2023 • Solo
I like the mission of the CNF. After being picked up in town, we walk some metres through the forest and received info about plants, animals and their actions which are impressive. The tour was not too long and afterwards we spend time there with drinks and snacks. We also watched the elephant eating snacks. It was a friendly atmosphere and I enjoyed the afternoon there.

Beautiful organization and incredible project!
Nov 2023 • Friends
Revisited this amazing organization this year. They're just as incredible as ever!

Always growing. Always learning. They have a huge enclosure for their endangered land tortoises now, and they've built a stunning Botanical Gardens on-site. They're building this out more.

The elephant is just as gorgeous and healthy as ever. The staff are happy and doing well. And the trees just keep growing!

Super excited for their future and to visit again sometime soon!

It was great to come back
Nov 2023 • Solo
I came back to CNF this year and it was nice to see all the improvements and especially the botanical garden, which is beautiful. There are tortoises at the moment waiting to be big enough to be released in the national park nearby. Planting forests is still a strong activity with thousands of trees planted in different areas in the past months. And the tour is always a nice opportunity to spend an excellent afternoon whilst staying in Pai.

Not recommended for families
Nov 2023 • Family
Team members were extremely kind, the mission was great, and the location was beautiful, but kids were bored because there wasn't much to do or see. They call it a donation, but it is not if it is a must. You must pay 1000 baht per person. Families shouldn't spend money on it, and it isn't worth it. If you care about the forest - just donate, you can skip the tour.

Amplifying Positive Environmental Impact
Aug 2023
I came to do an internship here as a student of forest engineering in order to learn as much as I could about Thailand's tropical forests and ecosystems. However, being a part of this amazing team and witnessing the amazing work they do has taught me so much more than just the basics of this topic. I gained a lot of knowledge about the forestry problem that Thailand faces as well as the various strategies this organization has implemented to contribute to the solution. This organization is indeed working very hard to restore the ecosystems of once-healthy and intact forests. After ten years, the results of the reforestation work done by this organization on plantation grounds are already spectacular, demonstrating the potency of their Framework Species Method replanting technique. Not only have I enhanced my understanding of the various environmental issues that touch this country, but I have also gained significant insights into the diverse range of solutions that exist. Being a part of this NGO's work has truly been an honor, allowing me to contribute and learn in meaningful ways.

Exceptional ethical conservation park you must visit!
Jan 2023 • Couples
Absolutely incredible experience. If you’re interested in visiting a sanctuary but questioning the ethics of each one, then this is the one for you. Miguel has created an example of what a non profit conservation park can be. Everything you could be doing, he is doing. From creating fertiliser out of elephant/cow poo to hiring ethnic minorities and paying them more than a living wage to planting 300-400 thousand trees a year. He has mangrove, coral and sea grass restoration projects beginning which is exciting! The experience was amazing, we were shown the process of fertiliser making, mushroom farm and lots of endangered plants. The interns here teach local school children and give them food. Their beautiful elephant Cami is being allowed to roam free in preparation for hopefully being released into a national park. We had organic passionfruit g&t’s on the house and snacks as we watched the elephant have hers. This is a gem for nature/wildlife/conservation lovers. If you want an ethical, local conservation project then come here!!! Your money is worth every cent!!

Phenomenal People, Excellent Ethical Experience
Jan 2023 • Couples
On thehalf-day tour our guide Thierry was wonderfully knowledgeable and charismatic. He and the rest of the team, especially Martin, were wonderful with answering all of our questions and succinctly explaining the aims, methods, and outcomes of the project.

We helped to seed 10 papaya trees each, and were fortunate to see the elephant Kami, who lives on their land. We weren't allowed to approach, touch or feed her, which is good. She isn't a pet, and it was a privelage to see her from a distance.

Lastly, we left our bag on the transport back by accident. The staff were truly wonderful and dropped it back to us in Pai in 10 minutes as soon as we contacted them. Genuinely couldn't ask for more kind or attentive people.

Jan 2023 • Couples
Fantastic experience, really loved learning about the environment in Thailand and the important work they are doing here. Met the lovely elephant, who is treated very well and is free to roam without bother from visitors, it’s great to just observe her eating bananas and living a free life. Would definitely recommend visiting.

Support reforestation efforts in Thailand
Dec 2022
We had a fantastic experience on the tour! Hippo, our tour guide, described the organization’s reforestation efforts in Pai. She discussed how the land used to be garlic and soy farm, but ever since the organization started planting lots of different trees, it's since turned into a rich, biodiverse forest. We saw a lot of butterflies and birds, and Hippo said sometimes there are monkeys.

We also visited a lot of different spots. They have a butterfly garden, a mushroom house, and a botanic garden. Then we walked through the demonstration forest, where Hippo explained the different trees they've planted. We also prepared papaya tree seedlings for planting. People can donate to the organization to offset their carbon footprint since the organization uses the funds to plant more trees.

Near the end, they gave us passion fruit drinks while we watched their elephant Kamee roam around. You could tell she was really well taken care of! It was fun watching her enjoy the bananas, her afternoon snack. This is a good place to see an elephant ethically

Overall, I would highly recommend the tour. Hippo and the other staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We could tell they care a lot about the project.

Inspiring eco-tour
Dec 2022
Conserve Natural Forests contributes a lot to forest restauration ! Not only in Pai but also in Krabi where they planted lots of terrestrial and mangrove trees, around 35000 trees. The CNF team contributes also to better understanding of the importance of forests.
It is worth visiting them since it exposes to forest issues beyond words and speeches. You can prepare seedlings, and see the nursery site while CNF explains what they do and why. A botanical garden is being prepared mainly focused on endangered species. For those who want to better grasp what is at stake with forests and also offset their carbon footprint, it is worth having their eco-tour. Last but not least, you spend a very nice afternoon in a charming place.

Very educational and interesting to watch.
Oct 2022
Cnf is a starting organisation with big plans to expend. The tour is very educational and gives the visitor a more clear view about what CNF does. They show intrest in explaning what the do and why its benificial for the nature in thailand. Instead of only getting the touristic view CNF tells the real story of elephants and nature in thailand.
So its worth booking a ECO-tour.

Great organisation with a love for trees and wildlife
Oct 2022
Conserve Natural Forests do a lot for nature! Lately they planted lots of terrestrial and mangrove trees in south of Thailand, I think around 35000 trees. The CNF team works really hard to create a greener world.
This tour is worth visiting to have a peek of what they do. You can prepare seedlings, meet the elephant Kamee, and have a look around the nursery site while CNF explains what they do and why. If you want to contribute your share for nature and if you want to have a great time in the middle of green, Book an ecotour!

What an experience !!
Jul 2022
I had the pleasure of joining the CNF family for five weeks on an internship whereby I helped build a house for the Mahout, who look after the elephant Kamee. The foundation is a non-profitable organisation advocating the importance of our natural environment. They are currently situated in Pai but they are beginning to branch out to the south of Thailand. By supporting this foundation you will be helping fight the battle against deforestation and supporting a brand which is hoping to spread knowledge in other areas of the world.

Enjoying the eco-tour, where you can plant your own tree, and donating to the cause will help CNF achieve their ambition of creating a greener world!

If you're in Pai check it out !

Incredible eco tours!
Oct 2021
My partner and I went for an ecotour and learned so much about reforestation and wildlife in Thailand! The CNF project site is quite beautiful, the tour takes a few hours but it passed by so quickly! It can be a little muddy so you might want to wear closed toed shoes.
We really appreciated that it was a hands off experience with the elephant and that she was able to just eat and hangout without too much human interference! It was awesome to just walk around with her and watch her be an ele 🐘🐘👍

Amazing experience
Nov 2021 • Friends
As my group came to the back half of our program, CNF was an amazing place to go. I had an amazing time planting trees as well as collecting data for tree research. It really gave you a hands on learning experience in the environmental science field. The facility was amazing from the small farm where they grew vegetables to the little dark room where they grew mushrooms. We even got to see an elephant roam around the property eating many plants. If you are also big on sustainability, CNF is also the place to go. They will teach you about certain plants and berries that you can and can’t eat in the area all while taking a beautiful hike in the vast forest in Pai. After foraging, you can try the freshest water that you can drink which the guides had set up using bamboo tubes from a small creek. All the guides really know what they were doing, they were all great in making sure you knew how to do some something if you were unsure. Our leaders Carly and Dan were great in answering all our questions as well as teaching us everything to know about CNF and the wildlife around us. They really give you so much information about the nature you are preserving. If you are going into the area, you should definitely do CNF, it is an unforgettable experience.

Incredible people and even better memories!!
Oct 2021 • Family
Such an amazing experience where you get to see elephants, help conserve the environment all around you including planting trees, picking mushrooms, collecting data, slingshotting seeds, and so so much more! The staff were some of the nicest people I’ve ever met… Dan, a great young man and super cool dirt bike enthusiast as well as Carly, an incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic young lady taught us tons about the environment and elephants! They both also participated in every activity with all of us during the entire experience. This made my time there feel much more welcoming and like I was a member of their family not just a tourist. I highly recommend and look forward to going back!

Amazing experience learning about reforestation, elephants, bio diversity and trees
Nov 2021 • Friends
Conserve natural forest is a must visit when in the Pai area, not only for the amazing experience but for what you actually learn there. We visited the project site and the team there seem to be doing brilliantly in terms of reforestation, wildlife conservation and education. We learnt about the process of planting a tree from it being a seed through to the germination process to actually planting a tree ourselves. We absolutely felt like we was taking the right steps to offset our carbon footprint.
The project site is in such a beautiful location with a lush river running right through making it a great location for Kamee the Elephant to live a healthy and happy life in an environment that seems to be perfect for elephants. We got to follow Kamee around in her natural habitat which was amazing while sipping on a refreshing passion fruit gin and tonic watching Kamee eat and forage for herself. If you love nature, elephants and learning about how you can make a better impact for the world then your gonna love conserve natural forest.

As advertised
Dec 2020 • Family
If you read their website, the visit consists exactly of what they say it will. This place is primarily about helping to return parts of Thailand to their natural state of bio diversity, both in terms of flora and fauna, with an emphasis on trees. Cami the elephant is an amazing part of the experience, and she is just that, a part of the experience as opposed to her being a tourist attraction. She comes and goes as she pleases, and is eating constantly! On our trip she was constantly near by while we learned about elephants in Thailand, reforestation, and other community initiatives. Very different from an elephant show, ride or photo op - in my opinion much better, as it felt like we got to spend time with her, on her own terms. Our kids had a blast, and it was a great afternoon.

Proper elephant conservation
Oct 2019 • Solo
I had a friend who volunteered here a few years ago and invited me to come and visit. It was an amazing experience and the elephants were pregnant at the time. This is truly a conservation that cares about the elephants unlike many other organisations in Thailand where the elephants are a tourist attraction. Would highly recommend a visit to anyone who's in the Pai area. 11/10

An incredible day
Feb 2020 • Couples
This is a great place with a great mission. They are currently rehabilitating Kamee, a female Asian elephant so that she can be donated to one of the national parks once she has re-learnt her natural behaviours. We were lucky enough to have a private ‘tour’ where you can participate in feeding Kamee the dietary supplements (bananas/corns etc) recommended by the specialists which is an incredible experience! The work they are doing here to fight deforestation is a great cause and one that needs to be supported. Please visit if you’re in Pai!

Ethical NGO, informative & genuine!

CNF is founded and run by people with big hearts & a genuine passion for the environment. Their elephant Kamee is a sweetheart, and they look after her tremendously well. This is the place to go to have an elephant experience that doesn't impact the wellbeing of the elephant :) I learned about reforestation, the history of elephants in Thailand, and their rehabilitation process with Kamee. Highly recommend!

Eco-conscious Local Conservation
Feb 2020 • Friends
Conserve Natural Forest is a local conservation NGO that allows you to give back to nature by letting you plant seeds to grow the forest even futher. Not only do they care for the plants, but the future for the animals in Thailand. Here they are rehabilitating an very beautiful elephant to be one day be released into the wild. Here the elephant is in charge and therefore no touching is allowed only looking

Most importantly conservation is the basis for every project done here and therefore this is a must tourist stop for all type of groups.

Great experience and a REAL ethical way to see an elephant
Jan 2020 • Couples
Highly recommend this afternoon our to learn a bit about reforestation in Thailand, more specifically the north. We had the chance to learn a bit about the plants and trees used along with helping to plant some trees ourselves.

We were also lucky enough to meet Kamee the elephant and have the opportunity to feed her. Having spent time at other elephant 'sanctuaries' I can vouch that this place really is ethical... All your interaction with Kamee is on her timetable and is for her benefit, not yours so no washing and and mud baths, just you feeding her some banana and passionfruits, which is funny to watch.

Finished off with a delicious passionfruit mojito it was a really lovely afternoon.

Great experience
Jan 2020 • Solo
It was such a good experience to see this beautiful place and to learn about reforestation and wildlife conservation! During the tour you can even help to plant trees to offset your carbon footprint a little bit. In my opinion a great way to give something back to nature and to the country when traveling as a tourist☺️

A very interesting and inspiring place with great staff that are very engaged and knowledgeable. You get to see the project site, plant trees, meet their animals and maybe taste the delicious gin and tonic. If you are interested in evironmental issues and find it inspiring and comforting to meet other people that also do this is the place for you.

Most wonderful experience in Thailand
Jun 2019 • Couples
The title says it all. This place is fantastic. Beautiful vision and energy. These people really care about nature. When we visited, they had adopted an elephant who would stay there until she gives birth, after which she will be part of a program of elephant reintroduction. We loved how they let her roam fence free. It was really magical being able to learn more about this project.

Excellent support, brilliant innovation, wonderful leader.
Sep 2019
My collegues and I organised a tree planinting expidition with CNF to off set our carbon footprint created from production.

Not only were we completely "wow"ed by the service and efficient running of the project, we were also increadibly greatful to recieve so much support and communication from management during our fundraising and marketing of the initiative.

CNF always goes above and beyond, we felt this when we planted with them, and we know that it will continue when we plant with them again.

This organisation is the best solution for companies trying to become mroe eo-conscious and would reccommend getting in touch with them as soon as you can to join the movement of of eco-conscious companies figting climate change.

Awesome place to visit!
Sep 2019 • Family
There are many tourist attractions in Pai. But I can tell CNF is an authentic experience. We visited this place in September with our child and the team lovingly welcomed us and showed us not only their forest, which they planted 4 years ago. They also introduced the local plant specieses and animals. Of course, meeting their elephant in the end was A highlight. An elephant living not at a chain, walking free around and living there in peace.

Thanks for this DAY!

Great experience with nice people
Aug 2019
Thank you Conserve Natural Forests for your wonderful actions on saving this planet climate. I am thankful for the remarkable experience in visiting the planted areas and taking part in a plating event this year. The planting technique is really great and should be adopted to all forests. I also like the idea to use elephant's poop, that's terrific. So excited to see how the forest will look like in the next few years.

Genuine experience going to a good cause
Nov 2019
This was a great, half-day adventure that felt very genuine and provided a lot of education about the reforestation efforts in the region. The day starts by riding in the back of a pick up to a beautiful location outside Pai. We are met by a friendly employee (spacing her name) who provides a history and goals of the preserve. She made a comment that she knows why everyone is here not to learn about the trees but to see the elephant, but I felt like it was super interested so I wouldnt make that assumption in the future and appreciated all the info on the fauna of the area!

The time with the elephant was super chill and genuine. Really well cared for elephant and they don't turn the whole thing into a selfi-taking petting zoo which is quite refreshing. You spend 2ish hours feeding the elephant and watching it hang out. The day ends with planting seeds/saplings, seeing their mini turtle sanctuary and drinking a wonderful cocktail by the river.

Highly recommend for a chill day in the jungle that respects the elephant on site.

Fun and super rewarding
Oct 2019
Let me be honest, I came to Pai to party and end up with an education in reforestation and sustainable development. Visiting Conserve Natural Forests is a great way to spend an afternoon while in Pai.

The tour went like this. They picked us up in town and drove us all to their conservatory which is about 15 minutes outside of town. At the conservatory, a woman named Hippo taught us about Conserve Natural Forests and their efforts to work with the local people to help reforest Northern Thailand.

Then we got to meet and feed their elephant named Kamee. They explained Kamee was there to help fertilizes the land and was not there for our entertainment. We were allowed to feed Kamee and take pictures. However, no one was allowed to ride her. I could see from my own experiences visiting so-called elephant sanctuaries that Kamee was extremely well taken care of and looked very healthy. I guess that’s because Conserve Natural Forests is not an elephant sanctuary but a reforestation NGO.

After that, they took us to their tree nursery to teach us more about reforestation in Northern Thailand and how we can off set our own CO2 emissions by planting trees. Which I thought was very interesting seeing as my carbon foot print had grown by just flying to Thailand.

Everyone got to participate in the planting of tree seeds and a chance to plant your own sapling. This was followed by an opportunity to ask more questions while enjoying a beverage. I would 100% recommend visiting these guys

A real way to support elephants
Sep 2019
This place is incredible and definitely a place to visit if you are in Northern Thailand.
A real place, with real intentions, with real nature, and real people.

An NGO that is buying elephants from fake "sanctuaries" and adapting them to be wild and handling everything on their own, before re-releasing them.

Wildlife is flourishing and you get to plant as many trees as you wish. We probably all owe mother nature.

Thank you for an amazing relaxed time and for the real impact you have for the forestation and elephants.

NB: Price is ONLY 1000 baht - which goes to staff, food, more trees and to buy and rescue more elephants in Thailand.

Really interesting project!
Aug 2019
Great alternative to other animal "sanctuaries"! Their wonderful elephant-lady walks around freely on their wonderful property. She will happily come by to get a snack from visitors and eat until she chooses to leave by her free will. If you're an elephant fan and want to support a project, that keeps their's truly free, this foundation is highly recommended. I fell in love with her immediately.
The other part of the project is reforestation. It is also explained by the friendly and funny staff. Visitors are asked to plant 10 seeds and a seedling in the soil in order to become part of the project :) This only takes 5 minutes and it's really fun! Understand that you are not paying a PRICE for a tour, you are giving a DONATION to a project which is truly worthy of your support!

Ethical and informative -- a must-do!!!

Conserve Natural Forests is the first place I've been in Thailand where the elephant is actually treated well and will eventually be released into the wild. It was so interesting and inspiring to learn about their work with forests as well. We got to see their forests and even plant some trees on our own. The people at Conserve Natural Forests care about what they do and their mission is so important. They had some pretty great gin-and-tonics with fresh passion fruit, too!

A Meaningful Experience
Jun 2019 • Solo
To stand amidst a land that was once barren, and now turned into a forest with life vibrating through it, was very inspiring. During my CNF visit I got to meet the sweetest people, who not only treated me like family, but are also very well informed in all the aspects of environmental conservation. I got to learn a lot about different tree species, and feed Kamee (their beautiful elephant) bananas. It’s comforting to know that this elephant is treated amazingly, and is part of their family. I would definitely recommend a visit there. Beautiful people, beautiful land, and a mad gin and tonic. It was truly a fulfilling experience.

The truck never came to pick us up from the meeting point!
May 2019 • Couples
We wanted to visit the conserve the 11th of May and arranged everything online. We had to wait at the meeting point at 13 o’clock. We are always a bit early and waited there. At 13 o’clock the girl said it would take another 10 minutes because the other guests had not arrived yet. Ok no problem. 30 minutes later we were still waiting in the 38 degrees heat. Still it was not sure how long it would take. We left because we have better things to do in our holiday than wait in the sun. It’s a pity. I don’t know if this is what they mean with sustainable tourism, but it does not work for me.

On behalf of Conserve Natural Forests I want to offer you our most heartfelt apology. An inexperienced motor-bike driver ran into our parked truck and our driver was unable to leave the scene until an ambulance had arrived. We sent a replacement truck as soon as we were apprised of the situation but unfortunately, this resulted in a significant delay. Unforeseen circumstances can always arise and I speak honestly when I say that we did everything in our power to rectify the situation in the moment. None of this changes that we failed to provide the free transport on time yesterday and there's nothing we can do now except to own up to our less-than-adequate service. We would love it if you came in free-of-charge any other day while you are in the area. We take full responsibility for our fault in this and we sincerely hope that you'll allow us to make things right. It is equally important to us to ensure that we take care of the individuals who visit our project-site as it is for us to care for the environment and the endangered species we look after. We are an organization that cares and it would set all of our hearts at ease if you would please give us another chance. We hope to hear from you very soon. Again, we offer you our deepest apologies. Sincerely, Jason, Miguel and the entirety of the CNF Team

FOR NATURE
Jul 2018 • Solo
CNF is a little different than other elephant attractions. It focuses on the health and wellbeing of not only the elephant species, but of other plants and animals. They have a competent and caring team of people who are dedicated to giving back to nature while helping you experience it. Instead of using nature as a prop for instagram, the nature is better taken care of. I 100% recommend CNF over other "elephant sanctuaries". Also, its on a beautiful river you can swim in if chosen and Miguel has bomb passionfruit gin & tonics for days.

A truly authentic conservation experience
Jan 2019 • Friends
I've been to a lot of different 'elephant camps' but my visit to Conserve Natural Forrests was fortunately totally different in a wonderful way.
Rather than riding elephants and having them put on a show for you, so you can take selfies for social media, Conserve Natural Forrests is dedicated to rehabilitating elephants, forrest regeneration and recreating the environment that elephants (and all animals) thrive in.
This is an opportunity to learn about conservation with a hands on experience, to contribute to a team with a vision that puts elephants and the environment first and our needs second.
To this point the elephant does what it wants, it doesn't perform for you, there are no rides, there is only the opportunity to observe a magnificent creature in it's natural state. We must respect it, we must allow it to roam, eat, swim, relax and do as it pleases.
The people who run this amazing organisation, headed by the outrageously funny Migel, demonstrate every day that they are serious about rehabilitation of animals and the forrest. It shows in everything they do.
We had a quick discussion about trees and why planting them makes so much difference to the eco system we are rejuvenating. Also the science of elephant poop and its phenomenal effect on plant growth.
Then we got to pick out plants, dig a hole, name ours and cement or contribution in the ground forever.
People talk about conservation but who is willing to support it? Who is willing to put thier money where thier mouth is? Who is willing to contribute their time and to put the needs of the animals before our own desire for entertainment or photo ops.
Lunch and drinks were available which were both cheap and delicious. The atmosphere is very relaxed and there's a placed you can sit and chill while you take it all in. You should allow as much time as you can to visit as you wont want to leave. It's only open for a few hours a day to allow the elephant to spend most of her time in her natural environment and away from humans.
Its possible to arrange a pick up from Pai if you don't have your own transport. If you have a scooter its pretty easy to find (quite a nice ride).
Once you have visited Conserve Natural Forrests once, you can go back any time for free. They encourage you to come back, plant more trees and reconnect with nature and recommit to changing the future one elephant at a time.

Dream come true!!
Oct 2018 • Friends
While travelling through Thailand a couple of years ago, I had already decided that I would not see any elephants as I was hyper aware of their unethical treatment that plagues Thailand. HOWEVER, after making anew friends in Pai, they told me about this magical place that has reduced a mother/daughter duo of elephants who happened to be pregnant at the time. Once we arrived, after crossing a very small river and getting a little wet, all of the elephants scratches and feeding awaited us. This was my dream come true! After giving them all the snacks, the owners's partner offers amazing Thai dishes that are beyond memorable! So be ready to eat! This experience was one of the best moments I had while travelling in S.E.A for 6 months.

P.S this place is an eco sanctuary and farm so you get the opportunity to plant a little tree and leave beyond a positive impact while you're one your travels.

Best Elephant Sancturary in Thailand
Apr 2019 • Friends
This is the one place where you know the elephants were actually rescued and are being cared for. They are never chained up and are free to roam around. You have a chance to feed and interact with the elephants as well as hear more about them. Definitely don’t miss it if you want to see some elephants.

Magical place
May 2018 • Friends
I am very skeptical about places where elephants are seen on farms. But I was there and saw it for myself. It wasn't not like a tour! The elephant would get out of such cruel "elephant riding" or "elephant sanctuary" tourist tours.
You do not ride on the elephant or take her to the water to have a bath with her.
You can feed the elephant, but only if it feels like it. She was so happy when se cames out to see us. She felt very comfortable with us and looks very healthy.

But it isn't only about the elephant. We planted trees, which is beautiful and extremely important for the world to plant more trees and keep it green! If you want to do something good for the environment, if you're traveling in Thailand, visit this place. Especially in Thailand, we use so much plastic, if you're on holidays or traveling try to give the world something back. Take care of our environment. 🙋🏼‍♀️
Visit this place and plant a tree and see the beauty! 🌱

It is all donation based. I found out about it because I met someone who helps and works there.

Elephant and reforestation project in the breathtaking mountains of Northern Thailand
Feb 2019 • Solo
This was such a beautiful experience. Their main focus is planting trees to save our forests and environment. Jason was incredibly knowledgeable about the project and was able to answer any questions about reforestation and taking care of the pregnant elephant, Cami. The land is breathtaking, we crossed a river to watch the elephant eat tons and tons of trees in her natural habitat. My favorite part was planting a tree. It feels like a family, we were able to relax with some delicious passionfruit mojitos and home-cooked Northern Thai food :) I would definitely go back and recommend it to anyone looking for a genuine experience.

Authentic
May 2018 • Friends
I visited a few years ago with my friend when we were on holiday in Pai. Being someone who Is very much against animals being used as entertainment or for profit, I was naturally very skeptical about seeing elephants in Thailand. I am 100% opposed to riding elephants and would not have gone to see them and donated if that was the case. The experience I had was something I will never forget. When I was there I met two beautiful and heavily pregnant elephants who were hanging out freely and playing in a little stream out in the forest. We spent house there (there was a very small group of us) feeding the elephants bananas. The two elephants seemed very content and happy and it was clear to me that these animals were living the best life they could and the owners of the conservation park had the purest intentions in doing what is right for them. It was truly a rare opportunity seeing and interacting with these animals ethically. I remember the guy working at the park (which was not gated or fenced of anything) to be knowledgeable, kind and gentle. He taught us how to plant trees and fully explained what he was hoping to achieve with the park. The fee at the time was a donation of our choice. I cant remember what I donated but I wish I could have given more.

Make sure you visit CONSERVE NATURAL FORESTS in Pai, Thailand .
Feb 2019 • Friends
This is such an uplifting place. Everyone trying to make a difference for the elephants and forests. It is a great elephant conservation project. I didn't know much about
elephant conservation before I went and I learned so much. Elephants are very intelligent and sensitive creatures. They have so abused in the tourist trade and made
to do hard work that damages their health and leaves them in chronic pain. This place
is a god send to them and educating the public about them. The tour was very educational, the guides were excellent and obviously loved what they were doing.
So nice to see people helping the elephants. Everyone should visit this place if they
get a chance.

Incredible way to support elephant rehabilitation and forest conservation.
Jul 2018 • Friends
This truly is the RIGHT way to experience elephants in Thailand. Its so much more than an instagram photo opportunity with an elephant (although there's that too). Learn how elephants play a key role in the health of Thailand's forests and know that your money is going towards making a LASTING POSITIVE IMPACT on the environment and elephants here. The owner and staff/volunteers are lovely people and you are guaranteed to learn something and will most likely want to come back multiple times before leaving Pai. I definitely did!!

Unforgettable Experience
Apr 2019 • Friends
I highly recommend visiting CNF to anyone staying in Pai! Unlike most elephant “sanctuaries”, CNF is an elephant rehabilitation area that purchases abused and working elephants and reintroduces them into the jungle (national parks). Miguel and his team are also planting thousands of trees and helping other indigenous jungle animals! Miguel’s passion for the project is infectious.

A visit to CNF is incredibly educational and an amazing experience to see a wild elephant doing its own thing. You can feed Kami bananas and watch her, but she is by no means exploited like other elephant centers. CNF can pick you up and in Pai and drive you to their land, or you can get there by motorbike.

I highly recommend cruising there on a motorbike, it’s an easy beautiful ride through the countryside. Just don’t drink too many of Miguel’s famous passion fruit gin and tonics 😉 If you get there early enough, there are some natural super hot hot springs about 30 min further down the road worth visiting also.

We visited CNF three times during our Pai stay to spend time with Mama Kami and to talk with Miguel. I can’t recommend this place enough, it’s definitely a must see when in the Pai area. Thanks for everything Miguel and CNF family.

A one of a kind experience
Apr 2019 • Solo
Conserve Natural Forest is a one of a kind experience. This is one of those rare experience, that is more education than tourism. You get the unique opportunity to see an elephant living undisturbed in it's natural environment. You also get to learn about the indigenous trees, and animals in this area. Shoshoni, Miguel and team were great, full of knowledge and information. I genuinely learned a few things while visiting.

The best part of course is getting to see the beautiful elephants living a free and natural life. You can rest at ease when you visit here because you know the animals are being treated ethically. I was so happy to be a part of it, even if it was just for one day.

Highlight of my trip.
Mar 2019 • Friends
Visiting Conserve Natural Forests was one of the best trips I've experienced so far in Thailand, out of five years of frequent visits to the country, and is a must-do for anyone hoping to find out more about the region's ecology while contributing to a worthwhile cause. The CNF team are extremely knowledgable about both reforestation and wildlife conservation, and it's clear that the Pai community are proud to host such dedicated NPO in their town.

While CNF isn't an elephant sanctuary per se, it is the best place in Northern Thailand to see an elephant up close and personal, and one of the only places I'd feel comfortable knowing the beautiful creature is being cared for as well as humanly possible - bordering on spoilt! There's a 1000THB minimum donation for entry, but this lets you come back as many times as you want, and it's a more than fair price for such an entertaining and informative afternoon. I also loved how easy it was for my friends and I to book the eco-tour through their website and arrange to be picked up in town and taken out to their land, all free of charge!

Very fulfilling experience in many ways. From the very beginning to the very end of my visit at Conserve Natural Forests in Pai I felt like home. Home because, you always feel this clean, safe and extremely respectful approach towards every living-being this organisation gets in contact with. This love and respect to nature was shared openly and with passion. Informative, educative and elephant friendly day! You will plant a tree at the end of your day and feel how much you’ve given only by being there. Magical place. Recommend 100%. I will come back to see how my trees are doing for sure!! :))

Amazing & Ethical Reforestation and Wildlife Conservation Eco-tour
Mar 2019 • Solo
Conserve Natural Forests is a small NGO dedicated to the rehabilitation of domesticated elephants and reforestation efforts in Pai. They rescued a 33-year-old and heavily pregnant elephant, Kamee, from a logging company and they are habituating her to the wild before releasing her to the Casablanca Wildlife Reserve. Elephants and reforestation go hand in hand – wild elephants need habitat in which to thrive and forest growth is aided by elephant dung. Visitors have the opportunity to observe Kamee and feed her fruit & vegetables. Kamee is in charge – she stays for as long as she wants and is not compelled to do anything. There is no riding, bathing with or touching her as CNF is trying to reduce her contact with humans as much as possible. Visitors also get to help germinate seedlings for planting come rainy season. It is their goal to plant 1 million trees this year!

The tours run from 1:30 – 5:00 and there is a 1000 baht minimum donation. They will pick you up and drop you off in Pai. If you wish, Hippo will make you a spectacular lunch and Miguel will mix you a passion-fruit gin and tonic. It’s a lovely way to spend an afternoon, learn about conservation, interact with an elephant in an ethical way and contribute to the restoration of Northern Thailand’s forest (and offset your carbon footprint!). A definite must-do in Pai!!

Remarkable Elephant Eco-Experience!
Jan 2019 • Family
Conserve Natural Forests offers an elephant experience that is unparalleled to any other elephant camp. Many people come to Thailand with the wish to see one of the greatest animals to walk the earth, but are blinded by the tourism sites available. Conserve Natural Forests is one of the only few to offer an authentic and natural elephant habitat that give tourists a chance to get a true taste of South East Asia. Spending a day with Miguel and his team will change your perspective towards animal care and how elephants live in nature. You will be amazed at what you get yourself into during an afternoon in Pai, Thailand!

Mar 2019 • Couples
We had an amazing experience visiting the Conserve Natural Forests site. Miguel and Hippo are so lovely and accommodating, they are truly two of this worlds most selfless people doing amazing things in northern Thailand to bring back an ecosystem that has been lacking for years. The reforestation program is hands down one of the best I’ve ever seen and their dedication is second to none. It’s reassuring to see people who want to make a difference on this planet and the whole crew at CNF is doing that and much more here! Our guide Suchana was really great and she taught us so much about the history of elephants in Thailand and how devastating the illegal logging was for the country in previous years. And then there’s the elephant! 🐘 Kommee is an amazing animal who deserves to be treated like a queen! The pregnant Kommee is ready to give birth any day and just being in her presence was an absolute gift. If you want a once in a lifetime experience with a good lunch and great people then you must visit the farm at CNF. Thank you so much for opening our eyes and making a huge difference guys!! Love all of you! And Kommee of course! 🐘❤️🙏🌴

Favorite Place in Pai
Mar 2019 • Solo
Conserve Natural Forests is by far one of my favorite places in Pai. The tours are so much fun! We learn all about reforestation and rehabilitation for tortoises as well as their elephant Kommee! It’s a great day of hanging out by the river and planting trees! CNF is my safe haven!

Great organisation for a good cause
Feb 2019 • Couples
I loved the aim of Conserve Natural Forests! They really care about the nature, the environment, and the eco system. An elephant was sooo cute as well and I enjoyed listening to the background story. The thing is that there are too much chill time that I felt awkward at one point staying with people being silent watching other people feeding the elephant. I just thought it would be more great if there is more learning activity or experience. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.

Top Thailand Experience
Feb 2019 • Friends
This is one of the best travel experiences in Thailand. I visited here with my daughter Olive Louise whilst hanging out in Pai with her. The work Miguel and the team are doing here is absolutely amazing. A very educational experience, I didn’t know that much about the history of elephants in Thailand and the problems with deforestation but learned heaps on this tour. Our guide Jason was just fantastic- very knowledgeable and passionate. The tour was intimate and sensitive, also so wonderful to see how Conserve Natural Forests are working hard to nurture their elephant Kamee to go back into the forest after her baby is born. Returning elephants back to the forest is absolutely necessary to ensure the forests can recover from the damage caused by extensive logging for teak. I do hope that Kamee gives birth without problems and returns to an elephant tribe when she returns one day. Great work!!!

Great work and people
Feb 2019 • Solo
I came to Southeast Asia with a plan to visit an elephant sanctuary once along my travels. With each potential stop I’d look up the companies and find questionable reviews and opinions likening these sanctuaries to circuses so I decided it would be something I missed until I could see them in the wild one day. Then I found a recommendation for Conserve Natural Forests and only positive reviews. That’s because this isn’t a circus show but rehabilitation for the single elephant they can currently manage that they will release back into the wild once her baby is strong enough to make the journey. This isn’t even the prime goal of the group, their primary objective is reforesting parts of Thailand with elephants being a integral part in that process (poop full of nutrients). The guides were kind and informative, and I really enjoyed my time with them and some like minded individuals during my visit and hope everyone considers this group if they want to see an elephant on their trip and support a worthy cause.

Shakin her big grey trunk for the hell of it
Jan 2019 • Friends
Incredible project!!! My deepest respect to Miguel who started it by rescuing a beautiful girl Kamee-the-elephant and the rest of the team, everyone who participates and contributes to this project - you are amazing. Jason, our guide, was contagious with his eyes lit up with passion, telling us everything there is to know about elephants’ life and about the sanctuary itself. These people are replanting the natural forest with their own hands and let you try and do the same: every guest gets to plant and name his own tree. Truly the best example of being the change you wish to see in the world. Kamee turned out to be very pregnant, 26 months - about to give birth any second. Despite having a whole entire elephant inside of her she keeps being very graceful and extremely cute. The place is worth spending a whole day there from early morning, it’s beautiful and serene. I don’t want to spoil more - go and see for yourself!

Thank you for your passion and hard work guys.
Visit, relax, enjoy and remember!

Respect, nature and perfect moment
Jan 2019 • Friends
Extremely happy to spend the afternoon at Conserve Natural Forests. The activity happens with a lot of respect for Kamy, the pregnant elephant. The only interaction we have with her is feeding and observing her. The tour is very honest about the elephant tourism industry and answer every question. Wes is also an amazing guide to explain the project of reforestation, which we participate to by planting a tree at the end of the day. I recommand this tour to anyone who wants a respectful moment with elephant and wants to contribute to a magnificent project.

So good I went twice in 3 days!!
Jan 2019 • Friends
I visited CNF twice in January 2019 and had a great time learning all about the history of the elephant industry in Thailand, the impacts of deforestation (we also each planted a tree!) and the story of their 26-month pregnant elephant, Kamee, as we fed her bunches of bananas and other fruit.

Our guide, Jason, was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive to our interests and needs. The tour (and organisation) felt very genuine and I would recommend this to anyone seeking an authentic, up close and personal experience with an elephant.

Thanks to Jason, Miguel, Hippo, and team - you're all doing amazing things for the elephants and the environment. I'll be back to see you again for sure!

P.S - those passionfruit gin and tonics are to die for!!

"Conscious and Eco friendly tour"
Jan 2019 • Solo
Conserve Natural Forests is such a cool place to hang out for a day tour. Here I got to learn about the nature as a whole being practically involved in a field. It's a rehabilitation center for elephants and endangered tortoises where we can see how the conservation works along with the going projects. Its about 16 km far away to the north from town and very peaceful and amazing. Their main focus is to increase the home for wildlife by afforestation which goes everyday. It was wonderful to get here and tour with them. It worth the time and visit with ambitious nature and the walk with crew members.

Learn, protect the earth, meet an elephant
Jan 2019 • Friends
This trip I learned so much about the history of elephant exploitation and was honored to support a project that cares so much about nature and the beings that live in it. The elephants was so well taken care of. I came 5 years ago, and again 2 years later and now. I got to see the tree I planted grow up and learn about the impact my little tree and support of this project has on the world. Conserve natural forests makes me believe that we can be helpful, one day at a time. The staff was so friendly and you see the love they have for nature and the elephant they are responsible for now. I wish her a great birth of her baby and I can't wait to visit again next year when the baby has arrived.

Best experience of my life
Dec 2018 • Solo
This place is incredible. I had no idea of the huge issue of elephant tourism that is present in Thailand. This organization takes it incredibly seriously and is determined to rehabilitate elephants for reintroduction back into the wild instead of using them as a tourist attraction. They are also attempting (and succeeding) at reforesting much of the greenery in the surrounding area. Every visitor that comes is encouraged to plant a tree in hopes that the enormously depleted forest will soon come back.
The staff is kind yet transparent. They don’t shy away from the tough questions that sometimes have brutally honest answers. They really care there.
They also have a land tortoise sanctuary for rehabilitating and repopulating Thailand’s endangered tortoises.
I HIGHLY recommend a day trip to see Kamee the elephant and plant a tree. You give only a 1000 baht donation once, meaning that if you go back two days, two months or two years later, you don’t have to pay again. PLEASE GO HERE

A nice experience where you can learn about reforestation and the true facts about the elephants in Thailand. Perfect choice if you've been wanting to get out in nature while gaining knowledge about the surroundings. There is a shuttle that will pick you up close to Pai center which makes it very convenient. Worth the $1000 baht donation.

Me and my friend had a great day at the Conserve natural forest project! The staff (our guide was called Jason) was amazing and we got lots of interesting information about the project, their elephant Kamee and about elephants in general. Their elephant is treated with the greatest respect and care. You can relax there, swim in a river, enjoy a nice drink and you get to plant your own tree! I am convinced that there is no better way to spend your money in Pai! Thx again for the unique experience!

Amazing Project, Must Do in Pai
Dec 2018 • Friends
I went to Conserve Natural Forests a few times when I was in Pai two years ago, and couldn’t wait to take my mom when she was visiting. This is a very unique organization that is working to combat deforestation, one of the root issues for elephants & other wildlife in Thailand. It is very educational. You learn about deforestation, the history of working elephants in Thailand, & you get to see tortoises, an elephant, & plant a tree. Miguel, the owner/founder, his wife Hippo who makes great Thai food, and our tour guide Jason were all awesome. When we went they had one very pregnant elephant (due any time!), Kamee. Kamee is being rehabilitated so that she & her baby can eventually be released into a protected forest. There are no hooks, chains, bathing, or forcing her to do anything or go anywhere. Tours are small groups and they only have one a day so that she has minimal interactions with people throughout the day. You get to hang out with Kamee, feed her some snacks, & observe her do & go where she pleases while her mahouts & the staff are ensuring the safety & well being of Kamee and visitors. When we were there in December there was a family with young children, and our guide clearly explained potential hazards & guidelines and made sure the parents & kids understood before starting the tour. When one of the children started approaching the elephant from behind, Hippo noticed right away and immediately brought it to attention to ensure the child’s safety. If you want to interact with elephants ethically, this is the only place to do it in my opinion. Even though other places advertise no riding, no hooks, etc, those elephants are still working all day every day & typically not treated well.

Most natural awesome little gem
Dec 2018 • Couples
A-M-AZING place, a MUST see around Pai! Why? Because it's about the only natural environment for an elephant in this area of Thailand (the elephant, Cami, is also pregnant and very charming to feed bananas to)!
If you like pure nature, river, flowers, trees... This is a beautiful spot. Plant a jackfruit or tamarind and help the planet mop up dirty fumes yay 😃
Staff are super sweet and passionate about what they do... Any questions are gladly answered too.

Highly recommendable project and place to visit
Dec 2018 • Solo
I visited the forest in Dezember 2018 and I was happy to find people, that really do care about the environment and their elephant. The iniciator of the organization as well as all the staff have a huge knowledge about reforestation and elephants. They informed us, that there is not enough forest in thailand at the moment to set all captured elephants free. That´s why it is so important to invest in reforestation. They have a pregenant elephant named Camee there, which is in very good health. There is no riding, washing or touching allowed but you are able to feed Camee with bananas - se likes them peeled ;) she has all the freedom to walk around in the 80ha land and as soon as the baby is able to they will both be released into the wild.
Besides the elephant and the dschungel, flowers, nature, it is a really lovely atmosphere there. They serve good and cheap food, passionfruit-gin and tonic and you can go for a swim in the river. They organize a truck from Pai, that brings you there and back to town.
You pay 1000 Bath and after that you can come back to this place whenever you want. I came back once and I will definitly go there again. Money is really good invested there :)

Regenerating the forest, one tree at a time
Dec 2018 • Solo
Found this organisation through TripAdvisor, and glad I did. I wanted to interact with Asian elephants in some way while in north Thailand but, having heard so many horror stories about so called sanctuary’s I was looking for a place without riding or either bathing.

Conserve Natural Forests is focused on regenerating the forest in what was previous agricultural land. By creating a tree species rich environment, the aim is to increase biodiversity of surrounding national park forest. All visitors have the opportunity to plant a tree at the end of the visit to help with this aim.

The organisation also has a breeding programme for endangered tortoises, that have been rescued from being eaten. That will eventually be released to the wild.

The secret to a healthy forest is apparently elephant poo, and this is produced in great quality by Kamee who is also heavily pregnant. Visitors have the opportunity to interact with the elephant and help to feed its daily dose of bananas. It goes without saying that there is no riding or bathing involved

The owner and staff were all super passionate about what they do. Well worth a visit.

Amazing organisation!
Nov 2018 • Couples
We heard about this place through a friend who visited last year so decided to look it up during our visit to Pai. The work they do here is fantastic!! The main focus is reforestation and supporting the eco system - each vistor will plant 1 tree at the end of the tour. We learnt so much during our time there about reducing carbon footprint, how many trees we need to cancel out or own emissions from our trip etc. The highlight of our trip was spending time with Kamee the elephant and seeing how well treated she is! The organisation work alongside other charities to rehabilitate their animals into the wild. (They also had some land tortoises which are going to be released shortly). We crossed the river and trekked through the forest to find Kamee - she is living as free as their land allows. She came across the river with us where we were able to feed her bananas and pumpkins. During this time she was still free to wander around us as we sat talking about elephant care and the work the organisation does - she is not caged, chained or locked up at any point and is cared for in the best way. She is currently 24 months pregnant and in a few years her and her baby are set to be rehabilitated into the wild. Wes was a fantastic tour leader and he was really informative!! The place also offers fresh cooked food and passionfruit gin and tonic - all just 50 baht each. All visitors pay 1000 baht but can return at any point and not pay the fee again! I cannot recommend this place enough.

Great Adventure
Nov 2018 • Friends
Before you book this trip you need to know that it's not like other elephant tours. Their main aim is to better the environment by planting trees and bringing back animal species not that common anymore. You'll learn a lot about the environment and the area around Pai. The special extra is an elephant which is in rehabilitation. You can follow it though the wild and feed it. They also offer fresh food and drinks for low prices. Only small groups are allowed once a day which makes it even more special.

Sustainable Tourism
Nov 2018 • Friends
Absolutely amazing time here today and the absolute number one reason for that was that this is an organisation that cares not just for the environment and sustainability but it’s local community and resident elephant, Kamee too. We had a great time observing and feeding Kamee (when she wanted us to) - but not getting too close and respecting her space. We also learnt a huge amount about conservation in Thailand and the rehabilitation of elephants in general. We were treated to a passion fruit g&t and also got to plant a tree in the ‘demonstration forest’. They do a huge amount of community outreach and education and are doing a really great job. Even if you don’t visit please visit their website and learn a bit more about what they’re up to!

Genuine Eco tourism - the real deal!
Nov 2018 • Friends
It was very joyful and relieving to see their work here. As Thailand have many so called "sanctuary centers" most of the are scams where elephants are rented and presented as rescued. This place was different. The elephant was rehabilitated to be released back into the wild. In other words were there no promises of tricks mudbaths, or other displays from the elephant. It stayed around as long as it felt like it (obviously it stayed as we gave it food) and hugging, kissing the elephant was discouraged. In other words, it was treated as an wild animal, with respect and sensibility. The care of the elephant was spotless!
Their main focus is reforestation (regrowing harvested forest) and they are quite good at it! They've even managed to bring back animal species that the locals thought were gone. We had the honor of being part of this process by planting a tree of our own (for free). The owner also made really good tropical gin & tonics that everyone enjoyed!
All in all I'd say that when it comes to genuine eco-tourism this is the real deal.

This is wonderful place to visit. It was the highlight in Pai.

The tour is very well organised and super educational.as a bonus delicious Thai food.

great, eco-friendly Tour
Aug 2018 • Family
We visited the project site in August 2018. We could spend quite some time with the elephant without forcing it to do anything like being washed or showing tricks.
We just feeded it which gave you a good chance to watch it.
We also planted trees and had a look at the tortoises.
A good half-day out which leaves you with a feeling that you´ve spent money on something good.

happy elephant - happy people
Sep 2018 • Solo
My first impression - I was amazed. At CNF I could learn about reforestation, wildlife rehabilitation and conservation.

First, they will show and explain you their running project of the endangered tortoises. After that a detailed explanation about the endangered species of asian elephants will follow and make you aware of the problematics, which most of us didn’t know. Currently they have one elephant named Kamee and its beautiful how they treat her. Kamee is free to do whatever she likes so she is not forced to do anything. This is a great way to show her the natural life of an elephant before releasing her into the national park!! It's not like other places where elephants are forced to entertain tourists. No riding, no forced bathing, no abusing, no chains. We just joined her with whatever she was feeling like doing. She looks really happy and healthy for sure!

Another big project they are working on is the reforestation. Their goal is to plant at least 1 Million trees a year! I also got to experience the project in first hand by planting a tree on my own. Since the tour is about 4 hours long, I had a lot of time asking the staff about their projects and about anything that crossed my mind. They are very kind and heartwarming people! And once you participate in a tour and donate, you can come back any time for free.

I would recommend this place for people who want to experience and learn about nature the right way. :)

Definitely THE spot to experience the real and right way an elephant should live and be treated. You get to know about Kamee, the nature and reforestation, plant a tree and the people who work there are amazing! Super friendly and happy to answer all your questions. The Pickup truck is also a very nice experience! Nothing to complain, would definitely recommend!!

Truly unique and inspiring!
Jun 2018 • Solo
I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for responsible elephant management and an eco friendly experience!!!

Before travelling to Thailand, I learned that many elephant sanctuaries are not what they claim to be, and that the elephants are mistreated and showcased for tourists. I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful treatment Kamee the elephant receives at CNF! They call her their princess, and it’s easy to see why. She has huge tracts of land to roam, and only comes to her pen when she knows she is going to bed fed bananas. The other half of their mission is replanting forests, which we participated in by helping out in the tree nursery and planting a tree of our own!

This was without a doubt the highlight of my Thailand trip, and I recommend it to anyone travelling to SE Asia!

If you want to meet elephants and their wellbeing is still your biggest concern this is the place for you. The atmosphere is super relaxed and everybody is very nice and easy goiy. Still you immediately see the passion these people have for their project. If you have a question you can ask any time. We got the chance to ride in the back of a pickup truck, meet and feed a lovely elephant lady, learn a bit about the reforestation and wildlife conservation project, saw some turtles and planted some trees. All in all a wonderful afternoon! Thanks a lot! :)

Inspiring project, these people deserve respect
May 2018 • Couples
Greay project, initially focussing on reforestation which is already great, but they also focus on reproduction of endangered wildlife in order to set them free. They have mostly 1 or 2 elephants saved from labour and abuse, and they learn the animals how to survive and live without humans. In the end they are released in a safe environment, completely free from humans. They also have projects with birds, frogs, turtles, but these projects depend on when you visit. Don't expect a show or forced interaction with the elephant. Normally the elephant always comes to eat bananas but they are free so they can come late or they can get sick of it after an hour and return to the jungle. This was the case for our visit, but it is such a great project we were happy to donate more than expected. If you hope for the best for the animals, this is the olace you should visit!

Unexpected circumstances, but wonderful experience still
Feb 2018 • Couples
On route with the pickup truck we found out that there was a forest fire around the site, and they informed us immediately that the day would not be a usual one. We thought of it as a special experience and took our chances, also to be there helping in any way we could. Their work focuses on caring for their elephant Kamee, and whatever happens, she and her wellbeing is their priority. So the "usual" activities that normally went on for the visiting donators (like us) would include feeding, bathing, and/or whatever else was on her schedule, meaning whatever she wanted to do. We were happy and honoured to be able to meet her, even though the circumstances almost didn't let us, and the staff at CNF gave us a lovely experience in the end.
Some of the visitors in our group didn't understand the bigger picture when they were told that the time spent with Kamee had come to an end, which was sooner that usually. They reluctantly threw their one-time donation in the hands of the staff, and left complaining about the absurdity they had been forced to "deal" with. It was very disrespectful and sad to see that they couldn't realise that what they, and every visitor, gets to be part of when donating to CNF. You get to help improve the life of a majestic and gentle creature, plant trees, get inspired from and learn about the work being done by the staff at CNF. Not only that, but you also get to come back in the future if you'd like, no additional donation necessary.
We had a wonderful time, and we are happy to support them.

Thank you so much for your review. Unfortunately, some issues can always happen in communication with people that you deal with but it means everything to us to have people out like yourselves who understand our mission. Environmental conservation and the ethical treatment of elephants mean the world to us and it's always important to remember that we are here for Kamee, she is not here for us or our entertainment. As you mentioned, the donation is only given one time and if Kamee is not in the mood to hang out with tourists on any particular day, it's always possible to come back for free anytime in the future. Thank you so much for your support. Welcome to the CNF community and please come back and visit again!

Great experience
Mar 2018 • Couples
Yesterday we visited the park and had a great afternoon. They will bring you with a pick up truck to the location and (we were with about 15 people) Miquel will passionate tell you about the project of rescue elephants in Thailand to give them a better home at his park. In the future there will be more elephants but right now there is one, pregnant, elephant witch will except his young one in may this year.

Then you will cross a river (water to your knees) to find the elephant and give her the candy's.... bananas! There is plenty of picture time and everything is in a relaxed setting. After this you will plant a tree to make your own little forest. The food and drinks are also very good!!

Where elephant is boss
Mar 2018 • Family
Chilled out place where the elephant is boss and we are her slaves! Peeling and hand feeding her bananas, shooing away the flies. Her carers collect fresh herbs for her health. Nice change from her past life as a slave to humans.
The whole centre here is centred around reaforestation as a means to protect endangered species and the environment as a whole. This year they hope to hit the 1 million tree mark. Great work guys.
Another thing I'd like to add is that the elephants that come here are bought at considerable expense with the end game being they will be released into a safe place where they can be free and wild. Your donations really are for the benefit of the elephants and the environment.

fantastic experience at/with a fantastic project
Feb 2018
There's lots of places in Thailand that use elephants to entertain us arrogant, selfish humans and make money for the "owners" of such wise and majestic animals, but not at CNF, an NGO formed to help and heal injured elephants until they can be safely returned to the wild of natural preserves AND they are working to restore the land by replanting hundreds of thousands of indigenous trees. It's all about the elephants and what they want to do, not about them doing what we want to do....I felt so blessed to find this place where all of the folks that joined us...except a couple older Germans who were, I guess expecting a circus act who were unhappy...but thankfully left....were there to share the same experience, and we had a wonderful afternoon of heart and love and sharing, eating fantastic food, drinks, swimming, feeding kilos and kilos of bananas to Kamee, and culminating it by planting trees, to contribute to the awesome work Miguel is doing. I feel so blessed to have been part of such a wonderful experience....Thank you!!!!!!!

Peaceful day, very nice people. If you only did one thing in Pai...
Feb 2018 • Couples
The elephant actually stayed after we finished feeding her banana to hang out with us. while chatting around the table she was enjoying her meal of cane grass but also coming over to sniff us out and say hi. You know she is loved here and that this is the real deal. Planting a palm tree at the end of the visit was very relaxing and took two minutes. I named my tree 'kasi suli' meaning strong plant in toki pona. They practice a special method of reforestation where they mix varieties of plants together instead of using a mono-culture. They also use the elephant poop as fertilizer so its a very synergistic holistic place. If you only do one thifng in Pai, this is obviously it. Miguel and Hippo you two are rockstars. To 1 Million trees!!!

Incredible. A must do.
Jan 2018 • Couples
If you’re looking for an incredible, personal experience to have with an elephant and get an understanding of ecotourism, look no further. If you’re looking to get a selfie with an elephant doing tricks for you, then look somewhere else.

At Conserve Natural Forest, you’ll spend the afternoon seeing a majestic animal in her natural habitat, feed her until she’s done eating (not when you’re done giving her a handful of bananas), hang out with her and learn about elephants while practicing eco tourism by planting trees.

Words do not describe how incredible and pure the experience was. There is a 1,000bat donation, but after learning that all the money goes into buying the food and paying for the 24/7 supervision so the elephant isn’t fenced or caged, we have more.

If you’re still reading this review by now, just go. You won’t regret it.

Incredible Place with the highest values and integrity. Best place in Pai
Jan 2018 • Solo
This organization is looking after everything from reforestation to animal repopulation. It is a non-profit organization that values the environment and animals above all else. It is a non-profit organization that is mostly self-funded. With their own money, they buy previously abused pregnant elephants, rehabilitate them, and then release them and their children back into the national parks. Extremely motivated and educated on all aspects of everything they're involved in. Great for families. Extremely wholesome. One of the best experiences I've ever had.

Amazing!! Had to go twice and wish I had time to go again!!
Jan 2018 • Friends
We had an awesome couple of days here with Hippo, Miguel, Kami and the mahut.
We went on a Saturday and it was a group of 6. The experience was very humbling so we returned the next day!! Kami (the elephant) is a beautiful calming creature to be around. We loved her! She is also pregnant so this was amazing to see!! She’s just like a human in that she is moody with her pregnancy but VERY VERY well looked after with her own playground and treated very well. No riding!! You do what she wants to do!
Hippo & Miguel are fantastic hosts and you come away feeling blessed with this experience. Due to the fact there is only one elephant, it feels very intimate. You get informed on deforestation and plant your own tree which is a nice way of rounding up the day! I will return if I come back to Pai and will follow on Facebook for the birth of the baby elephant! Thank you for the wonderful experience. A highlight of my trip thus far!!

Absolutely lovely way to spend an afternoon, while supporting a good cause
Jan 2018 • Couples
Conserve Natural Forests provides an extremely relaxed and really enjoyable experience. They are primarily focused on planting trees to help the damaged ecosystem in Thailand, but also in assisting endangered species. You give a donation of 1,000 baht to visit, but they very kindly insist that this means you can return again at any time for no cost.

They currently have one elephant, who is very pregnant and very happy. The visit mostly involves feeding her and spending time with her, as well as chatting the to extremely nice folk who run the place. They are doing important work to help elephants who have had tough lives- the current elephant was previously in a Burmese logging camp.

If you are looking for a way to spend time with elephants where you have absolutely no concern for their wellbeing, then this is the place to go! I highly recommend

Superb organization
Jan 2018 • Solo
An organization that works to replant forests, in 2017 250.000 trees and the goal for 2018 is 1.000.000.
They currently have 1 pregnant elephant that can roam freely and do what ever she wants, the few tourist that come get bananas and have to look for her and can feed her.
It's run by very friendly people and they are doing their best to get her an elephant friend

Amazing work and great way to spend the day outdoors
Jan 2018 • Friends
After checking out my options of spending the day outdoors ( and going to see elephants without supporting the elephant parks / cruel sightseeing )
I spent the day at the Conserve Natural Forest .
The sign up was easy , the pickup was organized and a safe drive down to the forest .
It was great to see a human place and really was a beautiful day !!!!
Highly recommend the place .

Great project and visit
Nov 2017 • Solo
Had the luck of being the only one who booked that day so i could feed the elephant for a very long time which is awesome. Dont expect a set agenda, the elephant has its own agenda and you live by it... which is how its supposed to be. Miguel and his ,sometimes, girlfriend are great people and easy to talk to.

Fully recommend!

Amazing experience. Great cause.
Nov 2017 • Couples
My partner and I loved visiting the conservation area and learning about the great work done to replenish deforestation and nurse elephants back to health.

We spent the afternoon feeding a beautiful elephant and learning about the project from the founder and his wife. Later we planted a tree; a reminder that tourism should not always be take take take.

I would highly recommend visiting and spending an afternoon here. At the very least, your money goes directly to conservation efforts and incredible work being done by such a small team.

Try one of Miguel's famous gin and tonics if you get the chance!

Fabulous day with elephants in the middle of jungle!!!! :-D
Oct 2017 • Family
Beautiful place, surrounded by a beautiful jungle environment
(in reconstruction)
in which elephants are at liberty, which can be observed in their daily and natural activities, which include the use of natural tools (rams, leaves) to meet their needs such as stripping a fruit from its shell or simply scratching using a branch.

you can also see the different native species that were previously eradicated to promote cultivation, and that today the foundation cultivates so that the restoration of natural forests is possible.
all this provided with a detailed and extraneous explanation of Mr. Miguel, responsible to promote and promote the project.

In the framework of this dream scenario, there is a river, which not only makes the view even more pleasant, but allows you to swim in it, and is the perfect environment to relax and relax, surrounded by true wildlife.

They also have a small menu to eat authentic food of the region, as well as drinks and refreshments.

All of the above, together with the fact that we are supporting the foundation, make this "jungle day" one of the best activities to do in Thailand.

And by the way...about "write a book, plant a tree and have a child", you can check from your list "planting a tree" , as much you want :D
They teach you to do it, in the right way and for the right purpose !!!

no doubt 100% recommendable

Amazing experience for the kids
Jan 2017
We totally amazed by the experience. Our kids get to be with the elephants for a long time since we drove there ourselves. And what made the whole experience more was the tree planting at the end. We planted 4 trees on the new year eve, and 4 more on the new year. Marking our green new year!

Most wonderful day
Sep 2017 • Couples
We were looking for a chance to see a happy elefant in nature and this was the perfect place. There is one elefant at the moment and a reforestation program of the whole 80000qm area. They know so much about the natural needs of elefants and their behaviour. Also they teach you a lot about the tropical forest trees, which they cultivate. And as an add on you can find a really remote nature place there to enjoy

I've been several time in that place and they re still doing fantastic things about elephant and reforestation. The new elephant Kamee is just gorgeous. You can see how good people there take care of her. Miguel explain me all the things I asked about trees and elephants and I learned a lot. Atmosphere is just relax and you can feel they re doing the good way. I could stay ages in that place. You feel good. Thank again to Miguel, hippo, bo And the mahouts.

Aug 2017 • Solo
Getting to meet Kamee, spending time with such great people in a mind blowing environment enriched with the best food and unforgettable passionfruit gin and tonic...all in all being part of this, even for just few hours, was truly a blessing. What CNF does here is admirable and it's easy to tell the value and sincerity of their project walking through the forest and witnessing the great life they give to Kamee.

Fantastic day
Aug 2017 • Friends
We went to conserve natural forest yesterday and had a really great day there. It started when we drove on the back of a pick-up to go to the conserve. We were a group of about 10 people, so that we got in contact with the guides really fast. They explained us what their organization stands for before we met the elephant ladie. She was allowed to walk freely and seemed to be happy as well.

This is the place you've been looking for!
Aug 2017 • Solo
The first time I visited CNF was in January. I had spent the better part of a month looking for a place where I could feel comfortable interacting with elephants, with their own comfort and health and happiness assured. As soon as I got here, it felt right. The drive out was beautiful (but the road is snakes around quite a bit!), the valley was green and the river was just the right temperature, and that was all lovely and everything, but it was the passion and sincerity of the CNF team and the obvious contentment of the elephants that really sold me.

Not only that, but they've done some outstanding work with their reforestation project. The eco-tour guide was friendly and informative, more than happy to answer all our questions after giving us a brief rundown of the project site. There's a definite sense of satisfaction when we planted trees at the end of the day, knowing that we can give a little back to the land we've taken so much from.

CNF is quite different from other places where tourists can see elephants: they let their elephants roam where they want, eat when they want, and basically do their own thing. They stress that the elephants aren't here for us; we're here for them. It's that perspective that really makes a difference between here and the many other places with elephants that I researched. It felt like the elephants had invited us into their natural habitat rather than the other way around.

And to top it all off, they have the best food and the best passionfruit gin & tonics in northern Thailand! Since my first visit, I've been back every time I'm in the area. Their new elephant Mae Kamee is simply lovely - sweet, calm, but with a certain spirit to her. Her personality really comes out when she's splashing around in the river. I can't recommend this place enough. They're doing amazing work, and they're doing it right. If you've been on the fence about elephant tourism but still want to interact with these astounding creatures, this is the spot for you.

Sustainable Travel, Relaxing Afternoon
Aug 2017 • Solo
Conserve Natural Forests is THE best way to experience elephants in Thailand. You can tell Kamee is treated with nothing but respect, and the emphasis is placed on her happiness, she is free to roam and eat as she pleases. Getting to feed her bananas is a blast! CNF not only helps in giving elephants a comfortable sanctuary, but they also make a huge positive impact with their reforestation project. When visiting, you get information about the project and get to plant a tree yourself, which contributes to the thousands of trees they plant per year. All in all, you will have a great afternoon relaxing, drinking delicious passionfruit gin and tonics, eating Hippo's authentic Thai food, feeding elephants, and learning more about what it truly means to be an "eco" tourist. Highly recommended!

Great time at CNF!
Jul 2017 • Friends
CNF does a really great job on their project site in Pai, Thailand. The drive in is absolutely scenic as you wind through jungle foliage, pass rice paddies and garlic farms, and make your way toward the Pai River where this organization owns a beautiful plot of land. After arriving, me and the other guests I was with settled in while one of the interns went through a nice introduction of what CNF does; what they're all about. We learned about the reforestation efforts and some of the history of this NGO. The site boasts 30 species of plants in their demonstration forest and walking through it was really an experience in and of itself. You don't really know what to expect until you're right in the middle of the thing.

Besides reforestation, this NGO has also acquired a female elephant, Cami, who we spent plenty of time with and fed bananas to. To see this elephant in a totally free setting where she could graze all day and make her own tracks through the land was really special. It's simply great to visit an organization that cares so much for this endangered animal, for the future of their species, and of course for a more sustainable future.

After feeding Cami a number of bananas and spending time with her, we went back under the shade and enjoyed a passionfruit gin and tonic and some Pad Thai made by some amazing cooks, and then chilled out for awhile and lost track of time. Eventually a CNF intern took us back into the demonstration forest, where we concluded the day with a tree planting session. It was very fitting to say the least.

Must do in Thailand
Jul 2017 • Friends
This was my first time visiting captive elephants, and I am so glad I chose Conserve Natural Forests. You know that this is a place where elephants are treated well, and your money is going right back into the organization. The elephants get to roam freely on their land, and the owners truly love them. Also you get to feed them as many bananas as your heart pleases. All in all, spending an afternoon at Conserve Natural Forests is a must do when visiting Thailand.

A.ma.zing!!
Jun 2017
Two beautiful heavily pregnant elephants have captured my heart. This was the first time visiting a sanctuary and it has set my expectations very high. The group was small, so there was plenty of hands on moments to create ever lasting memories, while being up and close.

It's very clear that these ladies are treated very well and are in great health.

The project is also promoting reforestation and encourages you to plant a few trees so they can reach their goal of 250,000 plants.

The staff were friendly and knowledgeable.

Don't forget the insect repellent! Especially after bathing eles in the river.

truly is a wonderful experience
May 2017 • Friends
I emphasize "experience" because a visit to conserve natural forest is much more than a day spent with 2 wonderful elephants. It is a day spent with friends and people who truly care about the conservation of the environment. The elephants are Amazing, they are gentle giants, who are very easy to interact with. The secret to their hearts are lots of pumpkins. They will literally eat them all day. The people who work there are super nice and very passionate about what they do. Once you get tired of playing with the elephants you can enjoy fresh delicious Thai food as well as cold beverages. Stop by for a visit. It is truly a once in a lifetime experience.

Amazing experience
May 2017 • Friends
We had a lovely day here. They have two lovely elephants that you can spend time washing and feeding, in a small group of about 10 people. We had really wanted to see elephants but had been worried about places not treating the animals well so we were really pleased to find this place where the animals can walk freely without chains and aren't forced to give rides. A really special place working on reforesting the local area and protecting endangered species. Definitely somewhere worthwhile to visit!

This place is awesome, they really care about their elephants and are passionate about the environment! It's so tricky to find a place to visit elephants that is actually ethical and treats their animals right, but conserve natural forests is definitely one of the few! They joke the "owner" of the elephants loves them more than his girlfriend. Such kind staff and you get to plant a tree too!

Great organization with an awesome cause! Definitely visit!
Apr 2017 • Friends
My friends and i were looking for an ethical elephant sanctuary to visit while in chiang mai. Since elephant nature park was fully booked, we decided to visit this establishment instead, and boy was it totally worth it. We got to feed and bathe two pregnant elephants in a small group of 12/15 people. Everyone was very respectful of the elephants and you could definitely see the respect the mahouts showed the elephants because they were not forced to do anything they didnt want to do. No riding elephants, no pulling on their ears, no yelling at them.
It was also eye-opening to hear that the sanctuary was initially started as a forest restoration project, which they continue to work on. Each one of the visitors gets to plant a tree to aid in the project. The staff (Miguel, Hippo, Zac, Do, and others) were very entertaining and informative, and I commend them for their commitment to a nobel cause. Definitely try Hippo's cooking (it was delicious) and Miguel's gin and tonics! The trek out to Conserve Natural Forests is worth it if you're in Chiang Mai! I hope to visit again in a few years to see how much my tree has grown and to see the baby elephants!

Enjoyable experience for all the right reasons!
Mar 2017 • Couples
An NGO doing perfectly ethical fantastic work. Cheap price to pay for a lovely day with 2 extremely pregnant elephants and planting trees. Well informative and the founder answered all of our questions and we had a lot! Make sure to support this great cause and visit whilst your in Pai, it restored some of our faith to see elephants living happily and being cared for so well. Don't support the brutal elephant tourism of shows and elephant rides you find elsewhere in Thailand, you will find much more happiness seeing these majestic creatures roaming freely in gorgeous scenery nibbling tons of pumpkin from your hands! When we went we were in a group of 10/12 which was also great :) you can book online via their website.

One of our best memories in Pai
Feb 2017 • Couples
I found Conserve Natural Forests on tripadvisor and the main appeal of the place was the fact that the elephants weren't chained up or forced to carry any riders. I talked my husband into going with me and we requested a tour through the website. We met them in town and followed the vans to the area with our scooter. The afternoon was incredible, we got to feed the elephants (they eat a LOT of pumpkins) and help to give them a bath. Both of them are pregnant but one was VERY pregnant (4 months overdue at the time we visited). Afterward you got to order some home cooked noodle dishes from the chef (they are delish) and have a nice passion fruit gin and tonic. At the end you help to plant a tree and the entire time you're there they explain their mission to you. The environmental protection project, as they call it, is absolutely wonderful concept. They've planted over 150,000 trees last year and want to plant 200,000 this year.
It was our last day in Pai and a memorable way to spend it. Highly recommend you going to visit.

Amazing
Nov 2016 • Friends
At Conserve Natural Forest we planted a tree to add to the tree nursery. There were two elephants that had been rescued from riding camps. We fed the elephants fruit and gave them a bath in the river (amazing!) Once out of the water we warmed up by the fire with a big bowl of noodles and watched the elephants wondering around. The experience was absolutely incredible and I would encourage anyone who wants to see elephants to do it here. By not riding the elephants at the camps you’ll help to make it a thing of the past.

Fantastic afternoon with the Elephants
Mar 2017 • Couples
Wow, what a memorable afternoon. Miguel and his team are providing 2 rescue elephants with the best possible care and attention in safe natural surroundings. You see the elephants up close, having the chance to feed them fresh vegetables l then watch them bathe in the river. They wander around freely.
Not forgetting to mention the tree planting and other eco activities that Miguel is obviously dedicated and passionate about.
This is definitely not to be missed.

Wonderful
Feb 2017 • Couples
After the bikeride we arrived at the Park. First we got more information about the park and afterwards you will cross the river and take a look at the two pregnant elephants! So cool, those animals are so impressive. You'll have a lot of time to feed them and you can help with washing the elephants (that is necessary! They've never learned how to wash themselves) and feed them even more. I really got the impression the elephants are here at the right spot. If I had more time, I would go voluntary.

Want to be with elephants? This is the best way to do it!
Feb 2017 • Solo
This was one of the best things I've experienced in my life! I'm an animal rights activist and hate the exploitation of any animals. I really wanted to visit elephants in nature, in a nice way.. was lucky to found this place through tripadvisor.
This NGO is an example against animal exploitation and offers this two elephants an amazing rehabilitation and big living space to enjoy their pregnancy, saved from the cruel riding business. Everything was so nice and peaceful, from picking up, visiting, feeding, walking and bathing them, you can see and feel clearly that they are happy and that this people are treating them well! We also planted some seeds and trees, had a delicious thai food.. I would spend some more days there or at least one night, if it was possible.
Will recommend this place to anyone going to Thailand and hopefully one day all the elephant sanctuaries will be like this one!

Natural interactions with free elephants
Feb 2017 • Solo
This is a great way to meet some wild elephants and support a fledgling reforestation project. They are not an elephant "sanctuary" which is often just a holding tank for elephants who are still held captive and squeezed for tourist dollars. These elephants perform no tricks and roam freely in the land. The former trainers guide them to the group for a feeding and a bath but it is a very organic environment that demands very little of the animals. A great relaxing half day with the animals, great affordable food and drinks available and caps off with a quick tree planting. A great day and well worth the 500 baht!

Best experience of my life!!
Feb 2017 • Friends
Had the most magical day here. What this organization does brought me to tears. Not only did we spend the afternoon with two beautiful pregnant female elephants but we got to be a part of something huge and plant our own tree - I named mine Fred☺️. Being with these elephants free of chains and in the free splashing with them as they got bathed by the Thai people who help this organization was magical. I found myself pinching myself to see if it was a dream. I caught myself with tears in my eyes more times than I can count. My favorite part about it was they don't call themselves a sanctuary. They are rehabilitating what we as people have been destroying for years. Please if you have time research this amazing organization and begin to follow them and there journey. If you are in Pai and or plan to come please please put this in your top things to do! Xxx

Fantastic!
Jan 2017 • Couples
Had a fantastic day! The staff and mahouts take real good care of the elephants, they don't have to do anything against their will. Definitely no riding etc.
It was magical to be allowed to feed and wash big, kind and impressive animals like these elephants, one of the best things we did while backpacking through Asia!

a good surprise!
Feb 2017 • Solo
I came to thailand to train muay thai, not really for turism, and normaly i get away from any crowded turist atraction. Then I heard about this place, where they have 2 elephants rescued from some nasty turistic busines at chiang mai, and they rase money for a huge reflorestation project. I went to check, not really convinced, and I really don't regreat it!
The two elephant ladies, both of then pregnants, spend the day eating pumpkins, and walking freely around in this big land. Nothing to do with the chained elephant riding torture. Even if there are loats of visitors, if the elephants decide to cross de river to have some fresh grass in the other side, no body force then to be there to please the public. Fantastic experience to be in the river with those huge animals, feed then with loats of pumpkins, seen then wondering around freely.
It's not all! I ate one of my best thai noodles since i'm in thailand! Hippo, this charming thai ladie, cooks all in fire wood, and she has some devine gift to prepare the best curry ever!
Then I try the gorgeus gin-tonic-passion fruit prepared by Miguel, with my feet on the river, chiling out, digesting the unforguetable curry...
I really recomend this place, and I wish good luck to Miguel, Hippo and their crew on this incredible project

Excellent Experience
Feb 2017
This is a wonderful project with great objectives. Miguel (CEO) speaks so well about the tree planting and elephant care that they do. The elephants are so well cared for and live in their natural environment. It was so wonderful to plant a tree with my young son. Such a great afternoon, spent with lovely people doing a great job. I highly recommend this. Go there!

An important project with inspiring people
Feb 2017 • Friends
After researching elephant centers and speaking with friends and travelers that have visited similar locations throughout Thailand, I decided to take a bus north from Chiang Mai to visit the hippie town of Pai for one reason: a trip to Conserve Natural Forests.

We were greeted by Miguel and Hippo, who explained the conservation to the group. They have spent years working on their projects, ranging from restoring biodiversity in the area to growing the populations of endangered animals. It was clear their team is passionate about wildlife, ecosystems, and making the world a better place. After a few safety tips and jokes, we were on our way to find the elephants.

We trekked with one of the mahouts - the "security guards" and "elephant whisperers" - for about five minutes through a beautiful stream and nature where we arrived at what appeared to be the corner of their property; just a few feet in front of me was the mother and daughter elephant grazing. Conserve Natural Forests was able to rescue these two beautiful mammals from a life of riding; the two were in paradise, 24/7 protection and visitors that had no intentions of harming them. They were free.

It was surreal to see a mother and her daughter, both pregnant, and both with a team constantly providing anything they could possibly desire: endless pumpkins, baths, and love. Each member of the group was able to feed them here and take countless photos with the two beauties.

We all walked together with the elephants back to the main spot, where we were able to feed and bath them. The experience was intimate and seemed to be the closest I could ever get to seeing elephants in the wild. For only 50 baht per meal, everyone was able to dine on delicious fresh food prepared by Hippo and her team. I have NEVER had Pad Thai that tasted this good.. I had to have a second plate :)

The experience was one I will never forget, and hope to return to Pai to visit the elephants with their new babies when they arrive. The travelers that recommended Conserve Natural Forests were not wrong; the world needs more people like Miguel and his team.

Amazing to see happy elephants
Feb 2017 • Couples
We were told to go here from some friends and we're so glad we did. Rescued from a company who made these two beautiful giants carry tourists from hours everyday, it was amazing to see how their lives have been transformed. It's really clear The owner and employees really care for the animals. A must do in pai!

THE BEST SANCTUARY
Jan 2017 • Solo
This is what I was looking for. Nowadays it looks like a hype to be a sanctuary. But there are a few real sanctuaries and this is one of them.

The way they handle the animals is really good. One of the guest was teasing one of the animals by holding the food on a big distance so that the animal could not get it. The host stood up and said something about it.

These Elephants are rescued from riding tours and are cared for till they are ready to live in Elephant reservation where no tourist come.

Great Job! Keep up the good work.

WOW
Jan 2017 • Couples
By far one of the coolest experiences.
The whole thing is very casual- right from the pickup spot to seeing the elephants to the drop off. No tricks, no commands, if you stop feeding the elephants they'll walk away and no one will make them stick around.
Such an amazing day to learn about Asian Elephants and experience their amazing calm demeanor.
Planted a tree and prepared seeds for next season- it was all a wonderful experience.

Oh and the passion fruit gin and tonics aren't so bad either!!! :)

Amazing experience!
Jan 2017 • Couples
Such an amazing experience. You are given some pumpkin at the beginning and you walk across the river to the huge, heavily pregnant elephants to feed them. You then bathe the elephants in the river and spend the last hour feeding them again. The elephants are so happy and content, it was amazing to experience. The group was quite small (around 20 people) so everyone took it in turn to feed them and take photos. The staff were all lovely and the food was gorgeous and cheap. The organisation only require a small donation of minimum 500baht which goes towards the nature and welfare of the elephants. I would highly recommend a visit, we will definitely be back.

Wonderful experience
Jan 2017 • Couples
While we already visited another elephant sanctuary, we were convinced by the owner of our guesthouse to join him an visit this place.
The place was amazing. When we arrived they immediately made sure we received some pumpkins to feed the elephants, which were just minding their own business somewhere by the river. We had an amazing fried rice dish with a nice cool drink, shot some slingshots and had all the time of the world with the elephants. Tomorrow we are going back, as one of the elephants is highly pregnant and could go into labor anytime. Highly recommended!

Slight letdown but worth it.
Jan 2017
The owner clearly deeply cares about not only the elephants but nature in general. But the trip could be organized much better. They sent all 20-25 of us to the elephants at the exact same time. This caused a lot of awkwardness and even anger as people fought for position for photos. Things got a little tense. They simply could bring smaller groups of 5-6 at a time across the river.
They do have pretty good food and drinks to enjoy as the elephants come to the river.
It just all felt like a bit of a money grab (I know they need it and believe it's going to a good cause). But we had that tourist conveyer belt feeling.
It also lasts too long. We were all more than ready to leave. And buy leave I mean in the back of a truck flying down the mountain side. I didn't mind this kind of transportation, but it's something some people should be aware of.
It's worth the 500 baht, but if you can drive or Motorbike yourself that would be best as you can leave when you like.

Best experience ever !!
Jan 2017 • Family
A great place with a great mission. They are a non profit organization surviving from donations, some government support and a lot of love and investment from the owner-Miguel. Their main aim is reforestation of areas in need in developping countries and saving endangered animals. The elephants there (two pregnant females- one due anyday now) are free to do what ever they want, they are not chained or hurt in any way. They were brought there from a camp where they were used for taking tourists on their backs all day every day for years...A very very warm recommendation, best experience in Pai area.

The only tour worth doing if you care.
Dec 2016 • Couples
This is the best elephant tour available. Not only is this non profit organization trying to save and eventually realese them back in to the wild, they're also planting critically endangered plants and trees in a very nice way.
They plant native trees in a way that eventually nature sorts it self out. They will explained this once your there. The whole planting part takes about 15 mins the rest of the 3 hours are spent with the elephants. They now have two pregnant ladies. One of them was to give birth in the next 2 or 3 days!! Might even be twins!!

We were so happy the whole time and everything felt so great. This trip makes all the other ones look bad in my opinion.

And also the gin tonics in the end are the best.

It was an absolute privilege to meet Miguel and Hippo, learn about the reforestation project they are working on, and of course, interact with the 2 beautiful Mama's-to-be. We loved it so much we went back for a second visit. If you only do one thing in Pai, make sure it's this!
P.s the passionfruit gin and tonics are out of this world!

it was one of the greatest expieriences i ever had. Miguel (the owner) and his Team really give you the Feeling of how important it is to conserve the Nature and protect the elephants. it is a real authentic sanctuary, where we never felt a single second they just do it for tourists. its also a lot cheaper than Other Programs (we paid 500 baht each). and they Are taking the money directly to Support their Programm. I can highly recommend going there. when you Visit there, also ask miguel for a gin tonic 😂

Best place to meet elephants
Dec 2016 • Friends
I stay at the organization as an intern for two month and only after one day I fell in love with this place. The people are so open hearted, the food is delicious and the elephants have a wonderful life here. The tourists can feed them, wash them and just spend some time with them. The rest of the day they can move free on the big and beautiful land. If you are in Pai it is a must-do activity to visit this place for one day.

Must-do activity in Pai
Nov 2016 • Solo
I went there by motorbike, the road is scenic and the place is beautiful. After meeting with other groups, we crossed the river to see the elephants, Kamjan and Maemoon. We fed them with pieces of pumpkin, it was amazing to be so close to them and watched them eating. Later, we got a chance to wash them in the river. In between these activities, I have also tried the great food and Gin & Tonic here, really worth trying. It was great to see the elephants wandering around freely, not being trapped in a small place or giving rides. Would definitely recommend this place to elephant lover!

THE place to see elephants in South East Asia.
Nov 2016 • Couples
This is a must-see. After travelling south east Asia for 4 months we had been looking for elephant camps to see and touch (not ride, don't ever ride them) and we are so glad we waited for this amazing place. Don't expect bells and whistles and anything fancy - this place is natural and kind and simply shows you the elephants as it should be. They are free to roam and eat and interact with you as much as they want. You walk through the river and have an opportunity to wash them and feed them and just be with them. It was brilliant. And so humane. Support this great cause!!!!!

Once in a lifetime experience!
Nov 2016 • Couples
What a fantastic day!

If you want to experience pure nature and elephants in Thailand, then the Conserve Natural Forest park is definitely the place to go. The elephants are treated very well, no chains, no riding and they are not forced to do anything.

Miguel and the time involved in the project are doing amazing things!

Highly recommended!

Please note that many elephant 'rescue' organisations are not what they claim to be and do not treat the animals kindly. This place is without a doubt one of the best ones.

Elephantastic Earth Enhancing Experience!!
Aug 2016 • Family
For a great start to the day I would recommend that you arrive at the meeting point, an hour or so early so that you can venture to Cafecito and enjoy one of the most popular brunches you will find in Pai. After which, you will enjoy one of the most spectacular drives of your life, that is the road to this haven.

You might have encountered Elephants before but, even still, prepare to be in awe. There are no words I can find to give justice to what I felt. It’s natural to feel initially overwhelmed by the Elephants but they have a charm and gentleness that will relax you. Before you know it, you will be closer than you can ever have imagined.

Both rescued Elephants are pregnant. The daughter is due any day, so not only can you see the baby calf silhouette around her body, you can also see it move and even feel it....it’s unbelievable!!

The founders are a delightful couple with a team of passionate workers who are more like a family. Everyone is extremely friendly and hospitable. Hippo makes the most fantastic Thai food and, if you would like a beverage, then just sit back and enjoy a gin and tonic with Miguel.

Moreover, the experience is very educational for those who are interested in conservation and those with children. You will learn not only about the Elephant rescue program but also about the primary goal of reforestation.

The day ends with the group joining together to plant trees that have been carefully selected by professional eco-graduates to best suit and thrive in a natural habitat. This is a wonderful opportunity to give something back and leave with the most heartwarming feeling from a day very well spent!! I can't wait to go back again & again!!!

Amazing day to remember...
Nov 2016 • Friends
Even though we were late and missed the meeting point it was the best day by now. The area is beautiful and the elephants have a lot of space. It was so much fun but also scary to be with those two beautiful elephants. The people who do all this are amazing and really nice but the most important thing is the elephants can walk around without chained on or in a cage and they can eat all day because there are so many trees with fruits and leaves. It is also quite an adventure to get to the place and back since they only have a pickup truck and only four people can sit in front and the others need to sit in the back and this can be funny if you have 13 people to fit in....
Long text, short meaning: Go and enjoy an amazing day there!!!

Amazing project!
Nov 2016 • Friends
It was an amazing day at Conserve Natural Forest! The idea of the project is just great. It was fun to hang out with the two beautiful elephants, who are both expecting babies soon (sadly not yet ;)). It would have just been great if someone came with us right from the beginning to tell us more about the elephants. But in the end there was enough time to ask all our questions! Highly recommended place! Don't go to an elephant camp and ride on one. Go to conserve natural forest:)

The most amazing thing we've done in Thailand

I cannot explain how amazing of a day that we had here. These elephants are so well taken care of and happy and you can tell just by their behavior. Miguel and crew are doing amazing work here with not just the elephants but with reforestation. I'm so happy that we went and got to be apart of this.

DON'T LEAVE THAILAND WITHOUT VISITING HERE
Jun 2016 • Friends
What Miguel and his team are doing at Conserve Natural Forests is exactly what not only Thailand but what South East Asia needs. The education above all they are providing for the local farmers will go a long, long way for future generations. As well as educating locals and tourist about the horrors elephants in the tourist industry go through. This is a day that will live in your heart for the rest of your life, and you feel instantly attached to the amazing elephants and feel immensely proud that you have help in some way towards the future of Thailand by helping replant the forest. I can not speak highly enough about Miguel and his team. If you leave Thailand without visiting Miguel and his elephants then you are making a huge mistake.

A must see experience in Pai
Aug 2016 • Friends
I've gone and experienced the Conserve Natural Forests Sanctuary many times in Pai and have loved it each and every time. Glorious food is put on for you. You can feed the elephants, go swimming in the river with them and just hang out in a relaxed environment enjoying these big ol fatties lumber around. It's an ethical and fun environment and such a unique and rewarding experience. I haven't experienced something like this the way I have done here in Pai. Miguel and Stephan along with everyone else who is involved put in such a great meaningful effort that make what the place so much better. A must see if you are visiting Pai or if you just want to experience seeing the remaining elephants of Thailand the right way. The G&Ts are also fantastic. Can't wait to go again!

Happy Heffalumps!
Sep 2016 • Friends
I admit that I have been one of those tourists who visited a commercial elephant camp and only then realised how wrong it was to ride the elephants and see them forced into a bathing pool so that tourists could splash them with water whilst they looked miserable and broken. I swore I would never do anything like this again and would encourage others not to.

I then started hearing so many good things about this project just outside of Pai called Conserve Natural Forest where they have two elephants roaming free on the land of their conservation project. It took me some time to visit but when I did I was delighted to see just how happy these big, beautiful ladies were! Both mother and daughter where both rescued from tourit camps and heavily pregnant… a marvel to see!

There is such a nice vibe at the centre between the project leaders, volunteers, mahouts and the Thai staff and you can see they all love the elephants like family…. you can even see that the elephants are very aware of this and grateful for their new life.

It’s a beautiful way to spend an afternoon, hanging out with these majestic beasts, learning about conservation and leaving a good mark by planting some trees. Another plus is that the ride out there is wonderful with stunning views of the surrounding area of Pai. You can either jump in the pick-up truck or ride out behind the group on your own bike.

Conserve Natural Forests simply ask for a donation which goes directly back into funding this incredible project. And you must try the Gin and Tonics and delicious food from Hippo’s Kitchen!

Highly recommended as one of the things you must do when visiting Pai!

A better way to meet and interact with elephants.
Nov 2015 • Family
A great elephant conservation project that focuses on the purpose of creating change by introducing an alternative that is natural and more sustainable. Conserve Natural Forest provides a better way to meet and interact with elephants. Your support raises awareness of the dangers elephants are exposed to when used for profit in the tourist and entertainment industry such as trekking and shows which often result in mistreatment and a harsh environment of living for the elephants. I highly recommend paying a visit, a moving experience that is great for the elephants and also your conscious.

Beautiful Experience
Oct 2016 • Couples
Where do I begin?! This NGO is changing Thailand for the better. We could see Miguel's (the owner's) passion for the land and wildlife. They are helping and healing the ecosystem through reforestation, conservation, and a lot of love.

My boyfriend and I had been looking to spend time with HAPPY elephants during our time in Thailand but are on a tight budget, and at 500 Baht/person this was by far the least expensive way to do it. Miguel rescued this mom and daughter elephant duo from a tourist facilitation where they were worked daily, and provided them land where they have learned how to be free elephants. Now they are both pregnant and will bring baby elephants into a harm-free world.

We also planted a couple of trees! We could purchase delicious food and drink. We learned much about the elephants and land. We bathed the elephants in the river. We were picked up near our hostel and dropped back off there at the end of the day. Also, those who give a donation are welcome back anytime free of charge. So great! Truly magical day. Please don't hesitate to support this organization.

Awesome time, Great mission
Oct 2016 • Solo
This was an awesome way to see elephants for the first time, as put by the owner (i forget his name), this was not meant to be a tourist destination. He has the elephants out of his pure love for the animal and his desire to help them as a species. Conserve Natural Forests is an amazing organization that hopes for nothing but to improve the natural environment of Thailand and the elephants who call it home! Very fun, cool way to interact with the animal. + One is about to give birth any day now!

The ONLY place to interact with elephants.
Oct 2016 • Couples
This place is the only legit elephant and forest conservation area to visit. Period. Both elephants (mother and daughter) were pregnant which is the whole idea...repopulation. They own the land, so the elephants can roam free and eat and bathe in the river. No pens, no chains, no riding or work. We got to feed them and get in the river with them and help these amazing creatures bathe. Lunch and drinks were provided for a nominal fee and we made a suggested donation of 500 BHT..so worth it. After hanging out with the elephants we were given three trees each to plant to help reforestation efforts which was awesome. They provided transportation from Pai for us and back as well. A MUST do while in Pai.

Best part of Pai. Amazing place and amazing people
Oct 2016 • Friends
I was in Pai earlier this year, after visiting CNF I ended up coming back almost everyday. What has been created here is inspirational, to see the elephants in their natural habit was unforgettable. Miguel and Hippo are two of the loveliest people I've ever met and wish them all the best with this amazing project.

Oct 2016 • Solo
I am very amazed at the love that comes along with this experience. I went in with zero expectations and left with an experience that i will never forget. Miguel, Hippo, and the whole staff of mahoots do an exception job with the rehabilitation and the development of the elephants. I was very impressed with the whole exprience and would recommend it to anyone staying in Pai for a few days.

A MUST DO!!!!!!!
Oct 2016 • Friends
Best activity to do in Pai! The most incredible afternoon ever! An amazing opportunity not to be missed! I couldn't believe how incredible CNF is. Like many people who are wary of tourists traps, I was rightly skeptical of a lot of NGOs in Thailand but can honestly say I feel so lucky to have experienced such a genuinely amazing project. CNFs sole focus is to conserve wildlife and reforest Thailand the right way. Miguel, Hippo and the mahouts involved in the project are amazing. Upon arriving at the beautiful land you can see the fantastic methods of conservation being used all around you. Then suddenly you are greeted by two of the most beautiful and currently very pregnant mother and daughter elephants returing from frollicing in the protected mountain jungle. I have always been cautious of engaging in anything elephant related in Thailand and sadly thought i would never find a genuinely 100% ethical project until CNF. These rescued majestic beings are now completely free to live the life they should. No riding, controlling in any form, restraints or chains just free to do as they please, how it should be. Spend the afternoon feeding them, getting to know their adorable personalities and even bathing them in the river to cool off! Another fantastic moment at CNF was planting endangered tree species, seeing the protect the tortoise project and learning about the importance of correctly reforesting the sadly dwindling thai jungles. Not to mention Hippo does amazing food and Miguel makes a fantastic G&T or sangsom to enjoy in between the action. Simply a must! I cannot reccomend this experience highly enough. I never review on tripadvisor but had to take the time to write this review of the most brilliant NGO experience of my life!

Conscious, sustainable, and really fun people!
Oct 2016 • Friends
We happened upon this place when talking to a friend who's been in Pai for many years. No riding, no "working" elephants here... just a growing land base being reforested, and a bunch of wonderful, hard-working, and fun people taking really good care of these animals. Hearing the story of how unique this project is, and where it's headed was so inspiring. We were also blessed to be able to help plant many trees on the property as well. This was one of our favorite days in the valley because of the people we met!

The cause itself is reason enough to visit, especially since its a beautiful part of the pai valley and easily a highlight. Perfect example of a place where you can travel with meaning and have a great time as well. Very dedicated hosts as well with good sense of humor.

Blown away by this place!
May 2016 • Couples
A couple of years back I was planting trees here in the north of Thailand with the team from Charn Chai Muay Thai and met the man with a plan Miguel. The aim of his NGO was to Conserve Natural Forests (as the name suggests!) but also to provide a beautiful, free and natural environment for rescued elephants to thrive in. Coming back to Pai and seeing that he's achieved this goal after so much hard work and perseverance, with the help of a small but dedicated team of interns, has been inspiring and a real highlight of my travels. Such an amazing experience I'll never forget. Big love to everyone involved. Looking forward to seeing how things develop with the organic farm, the birds and turtles, and when the little baby elephants arrive...

Good people doing good things :)

This really is the best and the only way you should see elephants. Get up close and personal with elephants while supporting a great cause. These guys are working hard to re-plant forests in areas where deforestation has had a terrible effect, while also freeing elephants from cruel tourist riding operations. They have 2 pregnant elephants and they are so friendly and happy. You can really feel something special here.

Amazing.
Sep 2016 • Family
Fantastic. A must see when in the Chiang Mai/Maehongsong region of Thailand. A refreshing change from the typical elephant riding camps which are so common in Thailand. No elephant rides here😊 The elephants here are free to roam in lush undergrowth, complete with a river where they can take a dip. Miguel, Hippo and volunteers do a great job planting to aid reforestation in the area, and Hippo cooks a great meal for visitors in the riverside kitchen. Amazing experience. Visit and DONATE to a great cause, unique in Thailand.

A truly wonderful experience
Oct 2016 • Family
If you are visiting Thailand,,elephants (of course) are probably on your list,,,be for you go ANYWHERE else,,,save your elephant experience until you get to Pai. In a wonderful,,natural setting,,,Miguel and his workers offer you a chance to see and get up close to these beautiful elephants in their natural unspoilt habitat. Gone are the days of climbing on the backs of these stunning animals,,no chains,,no chairs. I have visited twice now,,,as you walk down to the river,,the loud bellowing trumpet can be heard,,,Miguel has 2 elephants,,both pregnant and rescued from a working enviroment,,, the elephants are in wonderful condition. The pair were bathing in the river,,,shoes off,,,straight in the river to get up close and personal with these stunning creatures,,,much splashing of water,,,commenced!!! The mahoots are such nice gentle fellows,,full of laughs and giggles... a small bamboo bar serves cold beer,,gin and tonics at cheap prices. Miguel is a genuinely interesting and lovely guy..full of information about the elephants and the conservation of these animals and the forest they live in..,, with long term plans to re plant trees to replenish the forest of surrounding areas,,this guy IS giving something back. After a few beers and good conversation, the elephants made their way towards us,,where bananas, corn etc were plentiful to be fed to the elephants...a truly magical experience. This is not a tourist attraction,,,it is a genunine working conserve. A relaxed atmosphere in a beautiful setting with lovely friendly people. No fees but a donation of money is required, the final activity was to plant a tree. Such a lovely afternoon,, I cannot recommend this enough. Please visit here rather than the elephant camps,,you come away feeling amazing. I have in the past gone to other elephant camps,,done the riding etc and came away feeling guilty and disgusted at the way the elephants are kept and used for our 'pleasure', this is not the case here. A totally different experience. This is one place I will visit over and over, happy just to sit and watch.

OMG.. If you're in Pai you have to do this..!
Jul 2016 • Solo
Such an awesome experience..!
If you’re planning a trip to Pai, visiting Conserve Natural Forests is an absolute must..!!

I have been out to Conserve Natural Forests (CNF) quite a few times now and every time the experience is absolutely beautiful.. The reforestation program gives so much back to the environment and I am delighted to be able to stand back and say to myself.. “I planted that tree and, that one, also that one!” ha ha..

The elephants have taken my heart..!
During my time here I have had interaction with numerous Asian elephants and have felt wonderful powerful energy from most but CNF elephants (in my opinion..) outshine them all..
At times I feel like I’ve been invited right into the realm of the elephants.. They roam free..!

I have come to know the CNF crew very well and love their continual striving for improvement, the educational land development program, elephant liberation and strong passion for the project as a whole..

I highly recommend a visit to CNF..!!

Incredible place, beautiful elephants and inspiring people doing great things!
Jun 2016 • Solo
If you only do one thing in Pai, go to visit the beautiful elephants and inspiring team at the Conserve Natural Forests site.

My brother met Miguel on his first trip to Pai a couple of years ago and told me about this inspiring guy with a vision to repair some of the damage done by deforestation and farming of crops with harmful pesticides in the area by planting trees. He then went back again earlier this year and and saw how far the team had already come in those couple of years, saving mother and daughter elephants, both pregnant, from a life otherwise destined for tourist rides, and planting trees in the thousands now.
After a change of travel plans I decided to come here and see what he was talking about, and as promised I had an incredible day with the team, eating Hippo's (the fab chef!) amazing food, finding out more about the environmental issues from Miguel, Stephan, Julie and Margo and feeding and bathing these 2 incredibly beautiful and insanely pregnant elephants!
I told everyone I met in Pai they had to go there and went back twice more over the 2 weeks I stayed in Pai because I couldn't get enough of the elephants in this stunning natural environment and wanted to help the cause as much as I could.

There is a minimum donation of 500baht (which compared to other organised tourist elephant days is peanuts and not even comparable in terms of the experience) but if you can donate more this really is a worthy cause!
This covers food at the site and a ride in a truck to and from Om Garden (if you don't have a scooter, though the ride is stunning if you can do it), as well as spending as long as you want there feeding, bathing and chilling with the elephants.
You can also buy beers or G&Ts there for super cheap (and they're yummy!)

On my last visit there everyone planted at least 2 trees so you're also contributing to what will in five, ten, twenty years be an incredibly diverse forest and wildlife haven with hopefully lots more elephants roaming free and happy!
I hope I can come back soon to see the progress and the babies!!

Inspiring people and projects
Sep 2016 • Couples
Going to the Conserve Natural Forests project site was probably the best decision we made during our stay in Pai. Not only do you meet inspiring people who genuinely try to give something back to the damaged Thailand eco system, but you also get to enjoy the company of two pregnant elephants. When staying in Pai you should always consider helping these people out and wash some elephants!

An honest and sincere way to help the natural ecosystem of Thailand!
Jul 2016 • Friends
Conserve Natural Forest's was by far one of the highlights of my trip to Thailand. It was a breath of fresh air finding an organization that was making an honest and upfront attempt at helping the natural ecosystem in Thailand in various ways, from saving endangered species of animals to recreating the natural forests. Not only did I learn a lot from the small team of organizers who are making this miracle happen, but I also got the chance to do some real contributing. You get to interact with elephants in a humane and intimate way by helping wash them and feeding them, and also got to plant some native trees in the area. I hope to make it back one day to help contribute more to this incredible cause.

Miguel and his team are a true inspiration
Jul 2016 • Friends
The drive out to Conserve Natural Forest is its a beautiful and wonderful part of the journey, where you get a chance to see the less traveled roads of Pai. They don't pretend to be a great big attraction, they are just doing their best to do what is right for nature and the planet. Whether that be adopting pregnant elephants from abusive owners, restarting an entire plant ecosystem that had been damaged by pesticides from farmlands, building an aviary for native birds, or rescuing tortoises that are endangered from becoming lunch. The warmth that you get from these people is truly genuine. Their cooking and their gin and tonics are delicious as well. It is a great way to spend an afternoon and support some local conservationists who are trying to make a difference.

Unfortunately, my friend and I were injured from a motorcycle accident (Be careful out there) and were unable to get in the water to wash the elephants with everyone else. All the others loved that part.

Amazing way to interact with Elephants
Jun 2016 • Friends
I simply can not recommend Conserve Natural Forest's enough, it was a completely amazing experience from start to finish and a real education into the insight of what tourism has done to the wildlife industry in Thailand.
You get to see and interact with the elephants in there natural habitat, we got to feed them and bathe them, the staff where incredible, they spent time with everyone, we got fed amazing food during our visit too.
You will not be disappointed if you visit this wonderful reserve, their purpose and passion for what they have achieved are truly inspirational.

We went to Conserve Natural Forests together with a big group and ended up staying the whole day listening to the important work that these guys do.

It was simply amazing to sit and eat in the water while the pregnant elephants were chilling just a couple of meters away.

Best way to spend a day in the north of Thailand

My best experience in Thailand
Jul 2016 • Family
My sister and I really wanted to have an experience with elephants in Thailand. However, we were very afraid of picking an organization that does not treat the animals well. A girl at SpicyPai recommended "Conserve Natural Forests" and we booked a visit for the next day. We got picked up at OmGarden, had a great ride to the place and were crazy happy once we got to see two pregnant elephants. They bought the animals off tourist organizations that maltreated them and it was great to see how happy the elephants were, living free in the protected environment. It was amazing to get to learn about the elephants and how elephants are usually kept in Thailand from people that really care about the animals' welfare. Of course it was also great to learn about the problem of deforestation in Thailand and to actually get to plant trees! We were both just smiling all afternoon. I also enjoyed a freshly cooked Pad Thai while observing the elephants. - Best experience we had in Thailand!

I would say that out of all the elephant/conserve/sanctuaries I have visited that Conserve Natural Forests took my heart for what they're doing and trying to accomplish.

They have a wonderful support staff and a tremendous positive attitude towards what they want to achieve. I am happy that I visited them to get more information on elephants, the area they are in and just an overall education on helping the habitats of the elephants.

I think that anyone that is up in the Pai area show their support for this great program!

Incredible experience, enjoying elephants in their environment
Aug 2016 • Friends
Some backpackers told us to avoid the advertised elephants tours, because they do not respect elephants which are exploited and forced to work. This place is amazing, you simply have to give a free offer (minimum of 500 bahts) which is definitely worth the experience and goes into the support of the project. Best way to save money, support a great environmental project and enjoy elephants in their environment.

Amazing conservation in Pai
Sep 2016 • Friends
Thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Conserve Natural Forests - They have a great set up and are dedicated to the environment by restoring and maintaining not only their land but other places throughout the neighbouring towns which is refreshing to see.
There are a number of elephant conservations in Pai and Chiang Mai which I have never personally visited but have heard many things about, generally they are very touristic and overpriced starting at 2,500 baht for one day.
What i loved about this organisation was that it was donation based, minimum of 500 baht but feel free to donate as much as you like but the groups are small and its a very personal experience, they don't rush you and give you plenty of time with the elephants to feed and bathe them.
Also you are able to give back to the environment by helping plant trees or pack seeds for their future reforestation projects.

At present they have two female elephants (mother and daughter) who are both pregnant, one being due any day now so if you visit you'll most likely get to see the baby :)

Visitors are welcome every day and they pick/drop you off in the centre of town. time is 1-5pm and you need to book through the website or on their Facebook page!

If you are looking for a unique and genuine experience visit here and help them raise enough money to continue their amazing work!!

Adorable elephants
Aug 2016 • Friends
Came here with a friend, we had a great time hanging out and feeding the elephants, having some drinks with the rest of the group and talking to Miguel. For the price of 500 baht you can't really beat this place, plus it's for a good cause!

10/10 recommended!
Jul 2016 • Friends
I got to know about Conserve Natural Forests through a fellow traveler-friend. It is honestly an amazing place with passionate individuals genuinely caring for the elephants and environment. If you have always wanted to spend some time with some elephants at a sustainable organisation, i highly recommend this place rather than the extremely commercialized ones in Chiang Mai, and I'm sure you'll have as much fun as I did. :)

Unforgetabble experience
Jul 2016 • Couples
One of the best experiences i have had in Thailand. A place Where you know elephants are respected as animals and not abused by their owners. Everyone should visit and donate so they can rescue more elephants and make it a better place. You can feed them you can swim and Wash them in the river what makes this experience even more unforgetabble.

If you want to see elephants, come here.
Sep 2016 • Friends
My friends and I were looking for a place to see elephants where they don't ride or mistreat them. Luckily we found this place, which is involved in much more than elephants.

We rode with our motorbikes from Pai following their truck. Once on site we were greeted by everyone, including the two pregnant elephants (due very soon, when rainy season is over) and they explained their whole project which we were all so happy to support. Afterwards, we fed them endless amounts of corn and bananas and went into the river to bathe them. We had the opportunity to spend time and know all about them. At the end, after having lunch, we each planted two trees.

We had the greatest time and everyone was so nice! I would definitely recommend coming here.

Great place!
Aug 2016 • Couples
We drove by on your way to the hot springs. When we saw the elephants we decided to park our motorbike and walk down. Once down we fed the elephants and had dinner (really good) next to them. Then we planted new trees and spend some more time with the elephants. This place is amazing

Elephants and the environment! What more do you need?
May 2016 • Couples
This was an incredible day out in Pai! We drove our bikes out about 18 km into the mountains on the most beautiful winding road. On arrival at the site we were introduced to the two female (pregnant) elephants, Kamjan and Maemoon. They have both come from tourist camps were they were ridden 8 hours a day, every day. Now, they don't ride anymore! They are free to wander the land of the project site, eat when, what and where they want to. We gave them additional fruit treats and were then invited to bath them in the river. The best bit is just to be given the chance to observe them and know that they suffer no more.
After that the team at CNF explained to us their mission and goals for the future and what actions they are taking to help in the combat of deforestation, we planted a couple of trees on the land and helped in their organic garden.
It was such a special day, I won't be forgetting it anytime soon!

Amazing educational day with elephants and trees!
Jul 2016 • Couples
We had such a great experience with Conserve Natural Forests. After a 30 min drive through the mountainous forests of Northern Thailand we arrived at the project site. Greeted happily by Kamjan and Maemoon, the two pregnant elephants, that were obtained from tourist camps. The elephants look very content while just walking around, swimming and constantly eating. After our interaction with the elephants the CNF team explained the importance of forests and how to go about restoring tropical forests. We even planted a few trees and prepared some seedlings for next year's planting. Apart from the activities, the local chef, Hippo:), prepared us a delicious meal upon request. I highly recommend visiting Conserve Natural Forests.
