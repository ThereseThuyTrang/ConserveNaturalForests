Beautiful Sadhana Forest
Having arrived in Sadhana Forest with little prior knowledge but following my curiosity - after a recommendation by a fellow traveller - I simply rocked up and was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful energy with which I was greeted and the scale of the project. Taking a mini tour with a mid term volunteer (main tour runs every Friday at 4pm) I got my bearings, enjoyed lunch with the community and felt incredibly welcomed - a home away from home.

After lunch, I spent some more time exploring on my own, relaxing in the meditation hut and plunging into the mud pool. A beautiful evening followed consisting of dinner and an optional sharing circle for which I stayed having previously planned to leave mid afternoon. This magical forest had sunk its teeth in - I simply couldnâ€™t leave. The warmth of the local community blended with Sadhana Forest volunteers from further afield was refreshing and very welcoming - with all ages and a deep love for the environment and human connection, it had a strong family feel. With no money changing hands and not a donation box in sight, this is a beautiful example of the gift economy practiced here. This made it an easy decision to check-in the following day for a month.

So here I am, a week into my time here and loving every minute of it: practising seva (selfless service) each day - planting trees, cooking, cleaning and many more - demonstrating gift economy and living simply in a loving and inspiring community of people from all over the world. Impressed by its ethos and one of the most beautiful attractions in the Auroville area, this will always have a special place in my heart. After this initial month, I will almost certainly return and/or visit one of the other projects in Kenya and Haiti.
