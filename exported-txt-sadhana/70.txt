I didn’t know much before coming to volunteer.

It’s truly what i’ve been missing/seeking. a community based on ethics and love. open space to share skills/knowledge. reforestation with water conservation techniques. different activities all the time all fueled by delicious vegan food!

As a gay, atheist, vegan, feminist. Ive never felt more at home and challenged at the same time. The non- judgement and welcoming i have received almost feels other worldly in such a big group of people. not one single negative reaction to any of those labels. I feel seen and accepted. more than that i feel included and cared for.

As a vegan I knew this was the next step for me. I was reducing my impact but wasn’t giving back or anything more than that. I feel a sense of purpose a goal and passion ive been lacking for a very long time.

im contemplating becoming a long term volunteer. I am falling in love with this place and want to learn as much as possible to share this back home!

thank you Sadhana!
