Sadhna Forest made me realise the importance of protecting our nature and all the other natural resources we have. It's a beautiful and peaceful place that uses renewable sources to produce energy. The experience I have had here is the one I'll never forget. It's a wonderful experience and teaches us the importance of gratitude. I would recommend each one of you to visit Sadhna Forest atleast once as it is an amazing experience.
