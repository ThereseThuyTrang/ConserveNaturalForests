Amazing place with great values
I stayed here twice and both times I had a great stay learning about reforestation, veganish, zero waste, unscholling and many other things. The community is varied through out the year and always interisting people to get to know.
I would recommend anyone with an interest in connecting with nature and doing good for the planet to come volunteer her at this beautiful peaceful place.
