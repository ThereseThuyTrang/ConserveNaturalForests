Volunteering at Sadhana
The comfort zone of our daily lives makes the mind dull and makes life very monotonous. For me, Sadhana Forest is to get out of my comfort zone. It makes me feel very vibrant and gets me out of the rut of my own thinking process.

The whole place is designed to throw you out of your comfort zone, right from the dry toilets to living in a shared dormitory with fellow volunteers to working together in different sevas where you cook food for the community or clean utensils in which food is cooked or taking care of the forests and the community etc

The non judgmental space that this place provides one is another major reason for me to flock here again and again. Majority of the people who one meets here have in someway broken away from the established pattern of the society and they understand each other’s mental struggles and provide space for everyone to just ‘be’ and not be this or that!

The sense of community that one feels here is something special. All the activities and the structures are thought out in such a way that people come together and get to know each other. Human relationships are a marvellous thing once you get a taste of it!

I also like how people are not in a rush to achieve here. Their concern is with existing now and not with the ‘what next?’

The slowness of life here is what I really admire and would like people to experience as well. Happy volunteering if you make to Sadhana :)
