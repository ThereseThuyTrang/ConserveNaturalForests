A beautiful, simple and conscious way of life
A beautiful, simple way of life driven by so much love and compassion. If you’re looking to experience a more sustainable and conscious life and somewhere that truly embodies the promise of Auroville, I cannot recommend Sadhana Forest enough. Whether you’re looking to visit or in search of somewhere to call home for a while, Sadhana offers so much for everyone. The connections you make and the insights you gain through experiencing life at Sadhana are invaluable.
