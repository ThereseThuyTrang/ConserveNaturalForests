Creating the Change they wish to see in the world!
I recommend coming by for the Friday tour; bus leaves from solar kitchen; free tour and meal. Then you’ll see what it’s all about. Deep sustainablility! And tons of volunteer opportunities. Don’t just be a tourist, come live and work here for a week or two or a month or two, and get to know the land. :)
