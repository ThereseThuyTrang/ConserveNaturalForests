Amazing, wonderful, beautiful Lovely place one MUST VISIT
For me Sadhana forest is Heavan on the Earth. The space is fullll of love, compassion and highly energetic people. However one should spend minimum two weeks to really feel the energy, love and compassion. Very important suggestion don't leave the space without meeting Aviram and Yorit the founder of the this lovely places.
