Wow! The Highlight of My Travels!

Wow! The tour at Sadhana Forest was both fun and mind blowing. I cannot believe the before-and-after photos of this place. Through Veganism, volunteerism, water conservation, waste reclamation and sustainable living practices, they have regrown a forest in an area that was completely a desert.

I'm inspired to volunteer with these folks and will definitely recommend Sadhana Forest to my friends!
