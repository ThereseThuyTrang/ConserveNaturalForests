Wonderful conscious community
My experience at Sadhana Forest has been wonderful! The community of volunteers is very strong, kind and generous. The most beautiful aspect of Sadhana Forest are the connections that you form with people from all around the world. The community attracts a diverse range of individuals, all who are consciousness and warm. I enjoyed living simply and spending time in the forest with my animal friends! We participated in daily volunteer work, in areas that supported the maintenance of the Sadhana Forest community (sometimes foresting, other times cooking and cleaning). Eating delicious vegan meals together was a favourite part of my day, and rewarding after challenging work. The community is very organised, and so adjusting can be difficult. However, I felt well supported and cared for. I would recommend staying for a minimum of 3 weeks to feel integrated in the community.
