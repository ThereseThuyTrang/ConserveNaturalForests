A volunteering experience where you can help reforest the world.
First and foremost Sadhana Forest is a reforestation project. It has been running for 17 years when it was once an arid barren landscape, and it is now a beautiful forest paradise full of birds, flowers, frogs, and volunteers from all over the world.

This is a powerful project which is addressing the climate emergency, and is putting compassion and ahimsa into action.

But is is much more than a forest - if you come and visit you will see the amazing main hut where all the volunteers eat three delicious free vegan meals a day and have eco film club on Fridays, the kitchen where all the food is made by volunteers, the huts where we sleep, the mudpool where we go swimming, the library full of free books... And a real sense of community.

Most volunteers stay here for 4 weeks, some for a few months, and some for years. It is free to stay at Sadhana Forest, and there is a small daily contribution for food for those who can afford it.

If you want to come and find out more about volunteering here, come along for a free vegan meal! Either 8.45am, 12.45pm, or dinner at 6.00pm. You can talk to the long term volunteers about the incredible work which Sadhana Forest is doing to change the world for the better.

Come and be a part of this wonderful part of the world.
