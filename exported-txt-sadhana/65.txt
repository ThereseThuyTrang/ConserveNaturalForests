Great Community with an effective approach to water conservation.
I spent a week in this community with my study abroad group and got the opportunity to learn about environmentalism through a hands on approach.

This community eats a totally vegan diet, and uses only biodegradable soaps and cosmetics so this is something to keep in mind before spending time and volunteering here.

All of the community members take pride in the service they do and are happy to be contributing to the success of this community. Everyone is welcoming and eager to get to know you and your story.
