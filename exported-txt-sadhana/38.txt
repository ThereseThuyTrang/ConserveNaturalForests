Surprise yourself
The story of how this forest came to be is absolutely incredible, as are the stories of each and every individual who helped and continues to help sustain and grow this haven. Since people from all over the world come here to volunteer (many of them for years), one feels curious and excited about what this place has to offer.

This forest isn't just another getaway from urban civilization or a thrilling adventure to have, it is a way of living itself. Here, one can not only find the joy of community and harmony, but also an opportunity to rediscover themselves. Whatever background you may come from, whatever story you may have, the forest and its inhabitants accept you lovingly. I, personally, did not want for anything more than I had while I was here.

As by only experiencing can one fully understand any concept, so by only giving can one receive many times over. I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who is reading this to visit Sadhana forest and to give a part of yourself in service to nature and all its beauty. You only stand to be pleasantly surprised. I wish you the best!
