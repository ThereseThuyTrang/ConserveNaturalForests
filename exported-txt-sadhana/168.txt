Amazing place
Sadhana Forest is an AMAZING place. I applied for 6 months of volunteering in Sadhana Forest and everyday is more and more interesting here, it's a place where you can meet so many people of different nationality and different life feedback and knowledge. You can learn a lot about reforestation, veganism, unschooling, how to live in harmony with the nature, how to live consciously on the earth... I can make a very long list. Sadhana is a real place to help you to grow with the people and with the nature. You have to go in there!
