Sadhana forest experience
The community living , cooking n eating together- vegan ,millets, no chillies, almost nil oil and a well balanced one at that.
The birds.and a few animals visiting you, yet you feel safer and happier being one with them.
The goshaala experience is really satisfying..
The dry poo pans , water conservation methods and creative tools are worth memtioning , composting - the perfect 'zero waste ' practices , need of the.hour!!!
Mudroom is the most amazing fun element.
So much of good vibration , kindness and compassion around is a great take away too!!
Loving it all here ..
