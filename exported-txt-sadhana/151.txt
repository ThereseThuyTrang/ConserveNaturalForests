Thank you.
I volunteered at Sadhana Forest for a month and it was absolutely life changing.
I arrived as a smoking, alcoholic meat eater. Not only did the community (or Family I'd rather say) offer so much support that it made it easy quit smoking and drinking - but they also introduced me to the delicious world of veganism. As someone who has always had a problem with eating, I went from eating very little, to have 3 large meals with fruit snacks inbetween every day, and feel amazing for it!!
I've learned so much about the world, the benefits of veganism both for health and ethically, about unschooling, the water crisis, gift economy, and the importance of zero waste. It's not just a reforestation project, it's so much more!
I never expected to receive so much education in such a short space of time by so many interesting passionate people from around the world.
The living conditions are very basic which is perfect for the environment you're in, I found it very easy to adjust to.
I definitely recommend doing the "Eco Film Club" on Fridays if you do not have time to volunteer. In just a few hours you learn so much about the project and can take a lot away for yourself, as well as enjoying some delicious vegan food!
It has been extremely rewarding and I look forward to returning in the future.
