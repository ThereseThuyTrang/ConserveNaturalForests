Life changing
Excellent reforestation project that continues to develop and I think they have the solution to major problems in the world such as the climate crisis and animals being exploited as a resource.
There are many social events to get involved with being provided by people from cultures around the world. A truly eye opening experience.
Their values are closely aligned with mine, using a gift economy instead of a monetary system, compassion, non violence.
A must visit
