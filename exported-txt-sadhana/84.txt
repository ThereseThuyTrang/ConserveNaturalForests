place impossible not to LOVE
An absolute treasure not to be missed if you find yourself wandering around Pondicherry/Auroville! The most welcoming community that makes you want to stay forever.. It's a vegan community based on volunteering planting trees, taking care of rescued cows and dogs and cats, living sustainably and with the maximum effort to not only protect the environment, but enrich it! First we came with my friend on Saturday for the Potluck, which means free DELICIOUS vegan food for everyone, and the following week we did the Friday tour, during which we learned all about the beginning of this project and the way of living her.. and few days later we came back to help for a full day - planting some trees, fixing termite holes in the huts and enjoying the great food with all the volunteers- which made me decide to come stay with the community for a month! I recieved the warmest welcome and felt instantly as a part of a family - and it feels so good to participate in something meaningful in company of many many beautiful people. Can't wait for all the things that are about to come!
