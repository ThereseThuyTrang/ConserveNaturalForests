Sadhana Forest... Wow!
A group of kind, welcoming people, living a simple life in nature.

Great place for raising one's consciousness and going back to basics, educating oneself about ecology and of course living vegan.

Planting trees, cooking over a wood stove, cutting firewood. Important work on restoring an almost-extinct piece of indigenous tropical forest in India.

I recommend it to anyone wishing to be close to nature and live without cruelty to animals. Giving Sadhana Forest a couple weeks is absolutely worth it.
