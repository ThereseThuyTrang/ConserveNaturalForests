Sadhana Forest
Sadhana is an incredible experience open for everyone who wants to try living really sustainable. The location Can
Be reached by bike,motorcycle car and tuc tuc and is close to food and Auroville amenities. In Sadhana’s hits you would have all the peace and the relaxing sound from the forest as well as naturally fresh interiors.

Sadhana is a vegan community devoted to offer very yummy lunches, breakfasts and dinners. There are many events, including open intellectual talks on interesting social topics where you can learn a lot from others experiences and prospectives.
Other events include, talent shows, music, open pot luck food night, tea shop and film night.

Sleeping is Sadhana requires a commitment of 2 days for Indian people and 2 weeks for Foreigners. To become a volunteer means doing two selfless services for the community, yes this includes tree planting, you can attend them as a GUEST if you are interesed on saturdays workshops.

I strongly suggest coming at lunch time to Sadhana or doing the tour and having dinner at Friday.
Is a special place where very concilia and lovely people live. You won’t easily find other similar pure and interesting place.

Enjoy the forest!
