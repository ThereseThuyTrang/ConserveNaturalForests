Unique experience
I stayed two weeks as a volunteer at sadhana forest, it was truly a unique experience which advocates beautiful values such as veganism, minimalism, zero waste. The primary goal is to plant trees and conserve water.

We wake up at 6 a.m. to do some stretching and participate in community life, some will plant trees, others will chop wood, take care of meals and the hygiene of the different places. We work for around 5 hours with a break for breakfast.
In the afternoon we are free, there are often artistic activities that the volunteers offer. There is also a mudpool where you can swim, it is a very popular place.

It took me a few days to adapt to the living conditions, because even if I knew roughly what to expect, it's different to live it but in the end I got used to it pretty quickly.

There are volunteers from all over the world, which allows you to travel while staying in the same place.

I highly recommend everyone to come and experience it, the participation is 600 rupees per day to be able to pay for the meals, which is equivalent to around â‚¬7.

I will definitely come back.
