Shifted to veganism
A welcoming community atmosphere where we contributed to the reforestation project and volunteered our time to thsi unique community. We enjoyed eating, cleaning and cooking together. We lived in huts and loved spending our time in nature. A beautiful fun mud pool was a great place to swim and get refreshed.

My youngest daughter loved taking care of the dogs and cats on the property. The biggest surprise was after watching one of the weekly Eco Film showing my children decided to be vegan. They realized that the US food industry is very cruel to animals and they decided to take a stand. Thank you Sadhana Forest for allowing my children to make this imortant decision in their lives by themselves!

Yorit and Aviram, the founders, were great models of following their desires by creating a forest from arid land, not just in India but in Haiti and Kenya as well. I was truly inspired by the time my children and I spent here. It gave me permission to dream big about community living in my country of choice. A must stay!
