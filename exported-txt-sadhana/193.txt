Great Experience
The walk through the forest is beautiful, and the community itself offers a once-in-a-lifetime experience (for most people). It's an immersive journey with an educational movie-viewing - (normally pertaining to some environmental issue, we saw 'The Cove', and it isn't for the weak of stomach) - and of course, a fully vegan meal. So if you're interested in getting a true taste of Auroville, this is definitely a wonderful place to begin.
