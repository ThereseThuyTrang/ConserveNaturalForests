Conscious Living
The experience I had here made me realise how we can still be kinder to every living creature and how I can coexist. It was an amazing exposure for my 6 years young daughter to get to live in and being cared by mother nature and it's elements and she learnt how to care for it in return. We have a LOT of take aways definitely to implement in our daily lives. It just lit my conscious a bit more and I feel a lot of blanks got filled up. Being an unschooling family, a community like this, I had always been looking for. I am glad my daughter found a home in nature with a wonderful caring and conscious living community. So grateful to have got a chance to be the part and contribute something through seva to remain the part of this place forever. A warm stay with a lot of memories for life. Coming back soon..ðŸ˜‡
