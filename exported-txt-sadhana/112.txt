"Let there be more forests to grow people"
My partner and I visited Sadhana forest for just a few days, which is more than enough time to come away with something special.
Throughout our stay we interacted with many local and foreign people from all over the world sharing the same vision and ideas of how we should live as a community, how we should treat our own bodies, and how we should look after our planet. As a reforestation project you can connect with the forest and learn how the ecosystem works. It also touches subjects on un-schooling, gift economy, animal rescue and water conservation.
We especially enjoyed the Q&A with Aviram (the founder) who enlightened us across these various subjects, especially Veganism, and the journey of the project.
It can be challenging but is without a doubt a very rewarding experience, living this very minimalistic/basic lifestyle.
Adjusting to the vegan diet was not a problem as the meals were plentiful and nutritious.
The living conditions are comfortable, if there was any concerns the volunteering staff were very eager to assist!
Sadhana Forest is a short distance from Auroville (20 min bike ride) where we could enjoy an array of amazing veggie/vegan restaurants, as well as not being far from the beach and Pondicherry city.
If you are wanting an experience like no other in India, I encourage you to come join Sadhana (phone or email or simply turn up unannounced, everyone is catered for!) Either to visit for their Friday Tour, or stay and volunteer. My favourite quote: "let there be more forests to grow people"
Thank you for everything and see you again!
