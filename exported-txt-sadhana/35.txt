The best experience
We all look forward in life exploring and experiencing different things. And that's how I initially reached Sadhana Forest.

This place felt more like a place where I belong to. The people here are the warmest people I have ever met. This place helped me connect to nature better than before, it helped me connect with myself more deeply and with the community too!

Living in Sadhana forest helped me understand nature, the vegan food that Sadhana Forest offers helped me connect with my body and health much better. Sadhana Forest is surely a place where I would like to raise my kids. It is a place I would like to settle down at. Sadhana Forest is a place for everyone.

Would I recommend any others to go to Sadhana Forest? That would be a 100 percent yes! And if someone asks me why one should go there, I would say that you will find your own answers once you get there.
