One of my life's best experiences
A place full of love and compassion, where you do not compete against each other but cherish each moment of your life, sounds like a dream, but it exists in its true form, what we call Sadhana Forest. I had come there to spend a month but ended up living for three months. And today I call it my second home. You are in the middle of mother nature, adding more love to the surroundings. Seeing so many different bird species, traces of snakes, porcupines and many more on muddy pathways, breathing fresh air, not being surrounded by walls, having green everywhere; these are only a few of the details among many things beautiful about Sadhana Forest. They practice reforestation, water conservation, community living, gift economy, veganism to name a few. It is your inner Sadhana which happens once you are exposed to the world of hope and compassion Sadhana Forest is. You get the best food here, and the understanding of minimal living. I have made some very beautiful bonds in Sadhana Forest. It changed me, in the biggest possible way. It made me more human and taught me to love myself and others without expectations.
To sum up, you must visit this place if anything mentioned above is of even little bit of interest to you...
