An immersion into nature and sustainability
Sadhana Forest was an amazing and unique experience where I got the chance to deepen my knowledge regarding sustainable living and also be surrounded by the kindness & wisdom of so many like minded people! The food is a dream and the community is based is amazing values such as non violence, compassion, gift economy and non competition.
I highly recommend to anyone interested in reconnecting back to Mother Earth and nourish it in a regenerative and sustainable way. I know I’ll be back for sure eventually one day and I’m so grateful that I had this experience.
