Life changing experience
Volunteering at Sadhana Forest is a life changing and eye opening experience! The place just makes so much sense. They are doing their best to create a wholesome way of life, in harmony with all humans, animals and plants! Anybody is welcome to volunteer year round. You can help in their work of ecological regeneration and sustainable living. There is an animal sanctuary, a Children's Land, a tea hut, a weekly Eco Film Club. The community life is very nourishing and enriching. You live, work and hang out and have fun together with people from all over the world. There are daily social activities.

Sadhana Forest is built on very strong values, trying to realize a conscious lifestyle: substance free living, veganism, zero waste, non-competition, unschooling... I never encountered any place that combined so many of these powerful tools that help us overcome our discriminating mind, and push us to live a life that is inclusive towards all forms of life! I cannot recommend this place enough.
