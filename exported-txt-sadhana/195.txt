This place changed my life!
The Sadhana Forest community is one of the best places to learn about an eco friendly lifestyle, reforestation, sustainability, water conservation, compassion, vegan food and lifestyle and a thousand other things related to this topics. For me it was a life changing experience and I enjoyed every single moment of my stay. If you like to get a first impression of Sadhana forest I can highly recommend to visit on Friday, there is a free Bus from Auroville, a guided tour around the community and the forest, the eco-film-club in the evening and an awesome vegan meal, all free of charge!
