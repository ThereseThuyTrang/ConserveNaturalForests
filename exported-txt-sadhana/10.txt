Bliss in Sadhana Forest
Blissful Experience
Living in Sadhana Forest is an enthralling experience. Waking up to the sounds of nature, starting the day with warm smiles in a community of people from all over the world,  doing Seva , preparing healthy vegan meals, relaxing in the serene environs, learning about different cultures, learning and contributing to sustainable practices of living by conserving water and much more is what you gain when you come to this forest.
Being in sync with Nature, community living  & having healthy meals, works as a catalyst for one's own self growth. I was touched by the compassion way of living here, with people and animals living in harmony with each other. It's a delight for vegan travellers for getting all 3 vegan meals and an awesome vegan Masala tea made with coconut milk and Indian spices.
The pace of the day allowed me to unwind in the lap of nature whilst indulging mindfully in the volunteering tasks. It was amazing to learn and engage in conserving water by practising hand washing and cleaning utensils in such simple ways.
The accommodation is comfortable for toddlers and adults. An experiential stay, where each day feels fulfilled and blissful.
