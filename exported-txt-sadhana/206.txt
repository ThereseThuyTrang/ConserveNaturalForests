A school where I learn about myself through forests and nature
We are a Korean couple volunteering at Sadhana Forest. There don't seem to be many reviews here in Korean, so I'm leaving a post because I thought it would be helpful.

first of all! I think it would be good if I could tell you what kind of place Sadhana Forest is. It is a place that is difficult to define in one word, but I think it is a place where people who love forests and nature gather. It is also a space of practice where you can learn about others and get to know yourself better, and at the same time find answers.

All of the people gathered here are volunteers. I have seen people staying for as short as 4 days, 10 days, and as long as 7 years. I wake up at 5:30 in the morning, do seva (selfless service) for about 5 hours in the morning, and spend my time freely in the afternoon. There are various community events where discussions and talent shows are held. Anyone with talent can hold a workshop and share it.

The lifestyle is very nature-friendly. All meals are prepared vegan. Urine and faeces are treated with fertilizer, shampoo and toothpaste are all natural, and dishwashing is done with ash from a fire, not with pong. Individuals under 40 years old live in dormitories, while people over 40 years old or couples live in independent cabins. There is not even a common ceiling fan in the cabin. Electricity use is only possible when the sun rises. It seems like an unfamiliar environment for Koreans. You have to pay 600 rupees per person per day to the community, including all meals and accommodation. (Exemption for long-term volunteers)

People seem to gather here for their own reasons. Some people come to Sadhana Forest out of passion for the forest, others out of hope for the vegan community, and still others out of simple curiosity. We came because we were curious about Auroville, a spiritual community, and especially Sadhana Forest, a community that lives a vegan lifestyle while tending the forest.

I have never been vegan or vegetarian. While talking with many friends here, I was able to think about the environment, animal rights, unschooling, and a way of life that could be an alternative to capitalism. Rather than simply a place to plant trees and take care of the forest, I think it serves as a school that teaches the importance of nature.

If you are tired of life and feeling disconnected from nature, if you are wondering if it is really right to live like this, or if there is a different way to live, it would be a good idea to come to Sadhana Forest and sweat together to find the answer.
