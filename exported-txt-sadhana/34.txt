Transcendent experience
Iâ€™ve know about this selfless pocket of green for a long time but to actually experience it in person is like eden.

The serenity of the forest washes over you, inspiring you to be the best version of yourself. Growth Is a corner stone of Sadhana Forest.

Personally, the city life just got too overwhelming and I needed a space to escape to which would allow me to self reflect and grow. This community, their ideology, and my interactions with like minded people and the forest itself really helped facilitate this.

To be a part of nature in such an intrinsic way, and to give back to the community and forest felt transformative - the metamorphosis I so desperately wanted seems so much more tangible now.

Apart from the self development, to really feel part of a community (even within the short span I was here) and work towards something so much bigger feels really fulfilling and nourishing to the soul.
Being an architecture student I feel so much more confident applying the sustainable techniques that I learnt during my stay in my practices.

Coming here was a truly transformative process for me and I would urge everyone to visit at least once in their life.
