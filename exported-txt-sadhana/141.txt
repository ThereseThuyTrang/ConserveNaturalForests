Sadhana Bliss
Volunteering at Sadhana Forest for one month was a life-changing experience for my partner and me.

We loved living in a community of people who were similarly interested in raising human consciousness and who were passionate about sustainability.

A sense of inclusiveness and human unity pervaded the space and I really felt that the people there tried to cultivate kindness and compassion in accepting and supporting every individual who volunteered there.

The best part for me was the seva that we got to perform every day. This selfless service purified my heart and enabled me to become an offering to others by doing a task with devotion and care.

I also had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of values that I hadn't really explored before, including veganism, non-competitiveness, unschooling, permaculture, zero waste and gift economy.
