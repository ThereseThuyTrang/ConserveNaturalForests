Esha Lunawath
Sadhana Forest
It was a one of a kind experience. The community at the Sadhana forest was very welcoming. It was a surreal experience which drove me to rethink my choices and encouraged me to be one with nature and give back to mother nature. With veganism, unschooling and the concept of gift economy as some of their core values, this place is a must visit.
