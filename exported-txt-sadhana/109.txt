Sadhana forest ðŸŒ³
A place where you live and understand the importance of sustainable living, compassion, community, food, veganism, the environment and our planet.
The people here work together towards the goal of reforestation and sustainable living. You can see how passionate they are and itâ€™s inspiring.
The dogs, cats and the cows are lovely too.
Living here is an experience of its kind.
