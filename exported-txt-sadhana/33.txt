Mind opening experience

I heard about this place a long time ago, and was finally able to come volunteer a few months ago. I was expecting a lot, and yet I wasn't prepared for all that I experienced here.

The most incredible thing about this place in my opinion is the community. Living with people who all share the same values, are here for each other in the most compassionate way possible, and all striving for the same purpose is the one thing that was truly missing from my life before. Being independant is not a requirement in this life. Being able to rely on a small group of people, live with them, share anything with them and know that whatever happens, they will accept me for who I am is actually so much better. The concept of gift economy was also something that made me see the world in a different way. Giving to others without expecting anything in return, knowing that everything in this life is available in abundance and using that abundance to spread as much love as possible. That's something I never even thought about before, so stuck was I in our current system.

The second best thing is nature. Living here is not living in nature, it is being a part of nature, just as much as any other animal living in this forest. You can directly see the consequences of every action. Washing your hands? It waters the trees next to it too. Same for washing the dishes or showering. Cooking and eating? Anything that would be thrown away is given to the dogs, cows or composted. And all of it makes the forest greener, denser and full of life. We are nature, and nature is all around us.

I would recommend this place to every single human being on Earth. Some of it could be hard to get used to for some people, but the positives are so overwhelmingly amazing that stepping out of your comfort zone to come here would be worth it. Simply a life changing experience.
