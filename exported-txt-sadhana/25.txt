The Journey towards change and engagement.
On the 14th of November, 2023, I was fortunate enough to begin an inspiring journey in Sadhana Forest, a wonderful vegan community that magically filled 36 days, precisely 3,110,400 seconds, of my existence with extraordinary experiences. This community, loaded with the essence of acceptance and altruism, enveloped me in their arms and offered unfathomable love, rendering my stay in this idyllic sanctuary simply phenomenal.
Venturing into this journey, I had the exceptional chance of participating in the illustrious Plant 4 India fellowship program that the forest offered. The opportunity not only ushered me into a world of learning but also gave me the privilege to bring about a positive impact on this green community. This whole experience has been significant in shaping my perspective towards life and strengthening my commitment towards veganism.
In the realm of this amazing odyssey, today marked a day of double joy. It was not just the commemorative birthday of Sadhana Forest, but also the day of celebrating the loving union of long-term volunteers, Abhilash and Sandhaya. Participating in these celebrations, reveling in the festive spirits of the community, and imbuing myself into these delightful moments has left some indelible footprints in my heart.
In conclusion, my stay at Sadhana Forest has been a blend of many stirring emotions, learnings, and heartening experiences. These moments have enriched me, teaching me the importance of community living, organic food cultivation and highlighting the beauty of the place where kindness and love are the only currencies. I look forward with eagerness to the remainder of my days in this forest, and to all the invaluable lessons that await me in this sustainable paradise.
