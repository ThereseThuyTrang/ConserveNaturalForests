Amazing and inspiring place
I first came to sadhana after hearing of their Friday night eco film night through the visitors centre. I instantly fell in love with the place and came back the next day to volunteer for a month! I’ve never lived in such a caring community where the project is so worthwhile. Can’t recommend this place enough even just for a day visit, I can’t wait to come back in the future!!
