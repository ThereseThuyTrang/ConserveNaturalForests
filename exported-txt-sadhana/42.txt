Out of the box
Sadhana embodies the values it stands for.
It reflects in each person, who is residing there, and that's a difficult feat to achieve,
And as the name suggests if you wish to truly let go of the self, and engage in selfless practices it's the right space to be.
Also personally, I have felt disconnected from my body due to the nature of my livelihood and the kind of highly cognitive livestyles we live in. The few days I spent there helped me to stay grounded with my body, and just forget the daily grinds and be attuned to nature at its rawest.
