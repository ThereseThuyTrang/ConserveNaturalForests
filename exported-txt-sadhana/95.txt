Sadhana and ahimsa
I spent 5 weeks in sadhana forest and it changed my life. Being surrounded by so much compassion and warmth helped me to realize what I really want to do with my life. Doing selfless service to the community everyday without expectations pulled me away from the competitive, selfcentered thinking from our society. And in the end i gained so much by giving a part from me away. People supporting me, Helping each other, living simple and compassionate lives. You think its not possible or too hard? You should come and visit. You will be surprised.
There are many options here to learn about permaculture, animal care, veganism, unschooling, gifteconomy and more. By experience or by Workshops and talks.
I learned how to care for the cows in the sancturary and deeply fell in love with these beings. Come and cuddle some cows:)
And I have to add: the food is amazing and jumping in the mudpool is the best.
Its a great place for people all ages and backgrounds. The community welcomes everyone and shares food, housing and skills.
I will Come back to this place, a place that already feels like home, if I have the chance. See you there!
