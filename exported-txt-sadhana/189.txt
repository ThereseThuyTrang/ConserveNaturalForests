Test your comfort zone
Sadhana has been an amazing experiment for the last 10 years, based in Auroville and run by a aurovilian family they have a flow of visitors and volunteers to sustain the place.
Is worth a visit and a stay if you manage vegan food, pump for our own water and live in community.
