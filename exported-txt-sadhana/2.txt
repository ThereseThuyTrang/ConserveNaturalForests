Good!
The guide was really good in explaining the works they do and tons of tips and ways shared to better the environment. It's lovely to walk around and look at the plants and trees that were planted many years ago.

The guided tour was worth it and it was lovely that we were given a scrumptious vegetarian meal. The only down side I think is the show that they showed, it was some national geographic or BBC film. I think it would be better to show more slides/films about the forest instead of generic show.
