My favourite project in Auroville
I spent a little over a month here as a volunteer. I highly recommend coming to see this community, especially if one is visiting auroville. The best time to come is probably for the friday night tour. There is a shuttle bus which picks people up from the solar kitchen parking lot at 4pm. Dinner is included. People can come on there own and are welcomed for breakfast lunch or dinner.
