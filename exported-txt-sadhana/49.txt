Home away from home. Sadhana forest
Usually when you go somewhere you get excited toward the end of the trip to come back home. But after staying at sadhana it left like I was leaving my home to go out somewhere else. In such a short time everyone there felt like family to me. Everyone must visit sadhana. I’m definitely going to keep going back. No other place feels like Sadhana to me. I’m a short amount of time I’ve grown and changed as a person. I’m so much more aware of everything around me and had like a reality check about what’s going on around the world.
