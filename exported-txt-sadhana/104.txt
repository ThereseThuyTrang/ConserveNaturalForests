Volunteering at Sadhana with my children
I agree, I am blown away by this organisation. All the volunteers really walk their talk and the passion that they share with so much skill is remarkable.
Don't expect only reforestation, it's also about learning about vegan sustainable cooking on the fire, permaculture throughout the day, when washing hands, when composting your waste, caring for the cows in the sanctuary and enjoying so much more sharing!
A must! No minimum stay for families but you should stay at least 2 weeks, maybe 2 years!? :-)
