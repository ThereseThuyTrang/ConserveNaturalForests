The dream come true
I was dreaming a to live in vegan community and help to make this world better place and Sadhana forest made my dream real. The Friday tour was with maybe 200 people all the people there were happy and smiling the Eco movie was amazing and after the movie the volunteers start to serve us the food like one family and the vegan food was perfect on Friday and on potluck on Saturday. Thank you Sadhana for everything ♥️🙏
