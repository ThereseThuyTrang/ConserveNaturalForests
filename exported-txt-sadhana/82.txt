An amazing charity in the middle of the forest.
For the last 2 years I've been looking for a non-profit organisation that actually is a non profit organisation, which hasn't been easy.

I found it, its Sadhana Forest! I' ve been here for a week now and just signed up for 5 more weeks. Reforestation, Water conservation, animal sanctuary and helping local communities. Everything in one!
