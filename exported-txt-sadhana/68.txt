Beautiful experiment in Compassion!
May 2019
I visited Sadhana Forest for the first time in 2013. I have since stayed at the project four separate times and have been volunteering here for more then a year now. Over my time here I have met thousands of people from around the world. I have come to deeply appreciate the uniqueness and opportunity of spaces like Sadhana Forest. The project is driven first and foremost by values. The idea is not that everyone should have the same values, but that by staying somewhere that seeks to practice every aspect of life with integrity and dedication that we in turn learn about ourselves. The ecological work being done in Sadhana Forest is fantastic and is evidenced by the absolute transformation of the land. What cannot be measured is the effect of bringing together people from all different backgrounds from all over the world to collaborate towards a common good will towards the planet, all of its inhabitants (including domesticated and wild animals!), and., of course, to ourselves and everyone around us. The effect is creating a place for growth, which is driven by heart and not scarcity and fear. Sadhana Forest is a beautiful place to cultivate hope in a world that desperately is searching for a reason to change and to fight for our values and our belief in a sustainable and nurturing world. Come give us a visit sometime!
