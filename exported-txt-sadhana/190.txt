Inspirational community united by the power of intention
I have visited Sadhana Forest 3 times over the past five years, each time staying for about a month. I began visiting the project mainly because I believe that the ecological work being done there is important. Many projects plant food forests but few focus there resources on preserving ecosystems that are threatened by extinction. Seeing the utter transformation of the land over the past 14 years is stunning, but while it is easy to recognize the ecological work being done at Sadhana it is the community work that has really stuck with me over the years. The community structure provides a safe space for families and solo travelers alike to experience powerful growth, friendship, learning and spiritual growth. The substance free policies, clean vegan food, and commitment to non-violence give people space to reimagine the way that they wish to live their life and the values that they hold most dear. I am grateful for the existence of this project because I know that I will always have a home there and a playground for exploring self and building my extended family and community around the world. I cannot recommend taking the time to volunteer here more highly.
