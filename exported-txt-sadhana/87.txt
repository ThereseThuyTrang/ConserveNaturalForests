Amazing Sadhana Forest
I came to Sadhana forest in order to volunteer there.
This is such unique and special place.
Living for few weeks in a vegan community, planting and watering trees, taking cares of the cows, taking care for how much waste I'm creating (with wish to create zero waste),taking care for my use of water, not wasting any food since we share our leftovers with the cats, dogs and cows- all of those actions are part of the daily living in Sadhana forest.
I highly recommend to come visit or volunteer there.
You are always welcome in Sadhana forest, you can join any of the meals during the day as you wish (all vegan non processed food made with love and care), you can join the tour that runs normally every Friday, you can join the potluck- an event that runs every Saturday in which you can come and enjoy vegan food as well as bringing your own vegan dish and of course you can come and be a part of the community for a month or more.
Sadhana forest is an amazing place, one of a kind where I've learned a lot.
