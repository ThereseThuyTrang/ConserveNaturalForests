Way of Life!
Established in 2003, the founder members and volunteers of Sadhana have come a long way, to put Sadhana where it is today. The place is an almost self sustaining community that has been focusing on giving back to the nature, for we are always in its debt.
I was at Sadhana today (29 May 2019), for the first time, after years of failed planning. I was and am still astonished about how carefully each and every day-to-day activity is planned in this community.
I am inspired by them for working towards improving the lifestyle of all the living creatures. The planning that has gone into usage of water, consumption of food and disposal of waste amongst many others is the need of the hour in today's world.
Unfortunately, I couldn't participate in the activities except the tour because of my time crunch but I definitely hope to return for a longer stay.
Sadhana is not just a place to experience the bliss of nature, but is a way of life.
It's a must visit place if you're visiting Pondicherry and Auroville. The volunteers are an energetic bunch and are very jovial with their visitors. Kudos to Sadhana and its volunteers for all their efforts! ðŸ¤˜
