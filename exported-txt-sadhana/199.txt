Incredibly beautiful and exciting place
I went to one of the Friday tours and that was the time when I got totally blown away. They have so many good ideas about sustainable living and re-planting a forest. Also they show a movie and offer a delicious meal. I stayed longer afterwards to experience more of the work that is done there and enjoyed every moment of my stay.
