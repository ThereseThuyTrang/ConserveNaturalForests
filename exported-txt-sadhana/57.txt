Sustainable community working on ecological revival
Mar 2020
I have travelled a lot in my life, but I have never come across a place like Sadhana Forest! I have been here now for a week and have already learned so much about reforestation, community life, nature, zero waste, vegan cooking, unschooling, etc. And I just planted my first tree this morning! It is so amazing to wake up to the beautiful singing of the birds amidst nature, getting to know people from all over the world and support a project which is not only turning a desert into a forest again, but has also a lot of positive impact on the local Indian community. Sadhana Forest supports a non competitive environment, in which everybody can explore their own talents and preferences and even present them at the "non-talent show" once a week. Being over 40 my minimum stay would have been only two nights, but I will definitely stay longer. If you love nature and community life, I highly recommend to come to Sadhana Forest!
