My month in the forest
Just amazing! I stayed for a month, and thoroughly enjoyed myself, also while helping sustain our beautiful planet.
The people, the food, the ideology, the volunteering, all very interesting, fulfilling and honest.
A creative, youthful and safe environment.
Would definitely recommend
