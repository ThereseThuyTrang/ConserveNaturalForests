Amazing and inspiring place, don't miss it.
Sadhana Forest is an amazing project doing important work. In 14 years they have brought an enormous amount of plant and animal life back to their land, while at the same time exposing thousands of guests to reforestation, water conservation, vegan food, natural architecture, solar power, conscious living, and more. Anyone visiting the Pondicherry/Auroville area should come for the weekly Friday tour and free vegan meal.
