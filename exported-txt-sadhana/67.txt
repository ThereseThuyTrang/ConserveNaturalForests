Amazing Gap Year Experience
Oct 2019
I am currently travelling with a gap year program based in Portland, OR. Our theme this season is sustainability and spirituality. As for the sustainability portion of the trip, we were given the opportunity to spend a week here in Sadhana forest. To keep it brief, I'm going to summarize the pros and cons of our stay here.

PROS:
- extremely welcoming and kind community
- great (vegan) food
- secular community
- daily free workshops ranging from improv to yoga to salsa dancing
- close to Pondicherry and Auroville in case you want to explore surrounding cities
- great way to expose yourself to what a truly sustainable community looks like
- very unique and life changing experience as a whole

CONS:
- the weather is hot and dry, and they don't have AC
- schedule can be rigid such as waking up early to work around the compound and needing to be on time to meals
- only compost toilets, biodegradable toiletries, and non-processed foods
- bugs and critters such as dogs, cats, and cows

However, if you are willing to put in the work and commit to a sustainable and higher-consciousness-focused lifestyle during your stay here, I highly recommend it.
