Amazing what a vision and dedicated volunteers can do
I've taken the tour of the India forest twice - and each time seeing the before pictures of the desert and then walking through the lush forest just over a decade after Sadhana started amazed me. You can tell they learned much and put forward best practices as they learned.

In addition to the primary goal of raising the water table, I applaud their efforts in creating Children's space for the local village children. I volunteered at a primary school for a few weeks and one of the first things the kids told me was how much they enjoyed going to Sadhana.

I must admit that I personally would have a problem living there (sadly, I like my creature comforts too much), there are many volunteers who enjoy the experience and thrive there.

I am also impressed with Aviram's vision of expanding to Haiti, Kenya, and maybe other areas of the world in the future with reforestation efforts designed to meet the needs of the local population.
