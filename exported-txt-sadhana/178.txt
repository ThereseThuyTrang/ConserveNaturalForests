A breathtaking place
I stayed at Sadhana Forest for 2 weeks and found it to be a magical environment. At first I was a little overwhelmed living there but I quickly adapted and embraced it. It is admirable how they have managed to reduce waste to such an extent, and re-use as much as they can. The 3 homemade, vegan meals served daily are delicious! Volunteering there is a unique experience and supports a wonderful cause for restoring the planet.

I highly recommend attending the tour & film night which happens every Friday.
