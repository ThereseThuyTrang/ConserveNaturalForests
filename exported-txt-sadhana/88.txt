Sadhana forest
Sadhana forest is a community made from all different kinds of people who are living together by the same values they share.

The care for the nature,animals and environment is amazing like nothing I've seen before.
It's a good place to explore and examine the life you live right now in a way which is less damaging to the earth.
I've only been here for two weeks but I'm already thinking about extending my stay.
If you are in the area you are more than welcome to join the free tour on Friday, there you'll get all the information about the place plus an ecological movie and a meal.
