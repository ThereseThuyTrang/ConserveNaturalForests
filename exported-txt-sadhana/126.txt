Reforestation with Joy
Jul 2019
Sadhana Forest is a place that I absolutely recommend for anyone visiting Auroville/Pondicherry. It is a reforestation project that is in the process of rehabilitating an indigenous ecosystem on the verge of collapse. They are also deeply engaged with the lcoal villages around - a community centre was set up at Sadhana Forest to serve the local villagers delicious vegan tea made from coconut milk. The water conservation measures have also profoundly benefited the neighbouring villages. You can stop by for a meal, tea, delightful conversations or just a tour and all of this is offered as a gift! No charge involved for visitors and the people are ever so friendly and helpful. It's hard to resist such joyous celebration of unity, hope and compassion. The Friday tour is expansive and ends in a delectable vegan meal and is highly recommended! There are many organisations that make promises regarding reforestation but Sadhana Forest walks the talk by not only planting trees but wholly remodelling people's lives and their relationship with Nature. And all this, with smiles!
Are you looking to immerse yourself, even for a few hours, in Nature? Sadhana Forest is the place to discover yourself and your connection to the world around you - people, animals and the planet itself!
