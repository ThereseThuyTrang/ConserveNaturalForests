Volunteering in sadhana forest
Im volunteering in sadhana forest for a month allready, and i can say this place changed a lot about the way i see things in our world and society. It made me understand living simple life is not only possible, but also amazing. One of the main values leading the project is ecological sustainable way of living, in which we use the minimum amount of water, creating beautiful compost from the food leftovers and the toilet, not using any plastic and eating 100% Vegan non processed food. Living this way, i feel im giving back to the nature, instead of just take and take, when there is no more to take from.
We also Do massive reforestation in the land surrounds as.
The voluteers are amazing people from all over the world, and everyone influences in their own special way. Im here only one month and feel a lot like home. Doing somthing so meaningful and learning so much at the same time.
In this times of climate changes and global warming, we have to make a massive change in our life, and sadhana forest is a torch we can use lighting the way out from the big mess we made, and finding the way back to nature.
