A serene place to experience
I've lived in Sadhana forest for a week now, and I cannot express my gratitude for the impact the community has brought onto me. More than living in a secure forest area, it is about taking back spiritual values for yourself. If you are reading this, you must come and experience this place at least once in your lifetime. The food here is fantastic and very healthy vegan.
