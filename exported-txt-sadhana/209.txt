Great experience to live a different lifestyle
My time in the Sadhana Forest was incredibly inspiring. I have never found a place where values are learned and lived that are so close to my ideal idea of living together and are consistent. So many things are combined, from the way of life, the food to the way we treat each other. People from all over the world meet and are welcome.
It is important to know that a stay here (or living here - for those who are interested) is not to be confused with a vacation. Physical work, rules and a predetermined structure are part of the whole. This can be very exhausting and a little disappointing for some who need more creative freedom. But if you are open and get involved in life here, you quickly get used to the lifestyle and routines.
I particularly like the forest, where I go for walks almost during the day. The many birds...the sun...the lake where you can swim.
I can only recommend everyone to come here and have this experience. Even if you don't want to live a lifestyle like this, you take so much home with you.
