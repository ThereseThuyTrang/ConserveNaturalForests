Amazing few days in the forest!
Such an amazing place with beautiful people! Loved helping out the forest (planted my first tree!) The community was such an awesome place to socialise and meet people from all over the world and eat amazing vegan food! Will be returning in a few months for sure! Continue the amazing reforestation efforts guys!
