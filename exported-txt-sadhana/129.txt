When I arrived at Sadhana Forest, I didn't know what to expect. I knew it was a reforestation project and a vegan community but I soon found out that it was much more than that. Sadhana Forest is a community of compassion, of like-minded people from all backgrounds who share the dream of a better world and are figuring out how to realise it. It didn't take me long to commit completely to the all the sevas (selfless service) and to the values of this place and by doing so, I learnt and grew so much. Their main focus lies on reforestation and water conservation and those are taken very seriously, as they should be. But besides that there is a strong sense of community that bonds it all together, from morning to sharing circles. It's such a safe, non-judgemental environment where everybody is valued for what they can and want to give and not for how they perform in doing so. I had an unforgettable experience, had some of the best conversations of my life with the most amazing people and gained so much knowledge about alternative and sustainable ways of doing things. I'm taking with me so many "seeds" from this wonderful forests that grows people.
