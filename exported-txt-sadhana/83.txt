Being at home at Sadhana Forest!
There’s a positive mind, heart and spirit experience available to those staying at Sadhana Forest, helping carry out the daily seva offerings whether planting trees, tending them, cooking meals, helping care for the beloved animals or having some wild fun making costumes from the Zero Waste Hut for a “Trashion Show.”

From the early morning sounds of birds and neighbors’ soft voices to the loud squawks of gorgeous wandering peacocks and full conversations (over the 3 healthy vegan meals made and served each day); from the moments of silence to the tunes of guitar, accordion & flute music drifting in and out - there is learning, there is magic, and there is healing in the air.

And then there’s the mud pool. It almost should be kept a top secret. But we like to share our abundance here...& the Mud Pool is a delight to share: refreshing, cool and warm in different spots and fun as can be! and like so much else here it has an intriguing history and sooo much went into making it.

I love it here and find the long term volunteers, residents and staff here very welcoming. They are informed, passionate and committed to carrying out the vision and mission here. And the mission resonates with me - ( in my own words) to restore the water table, to reforest the once severely-dried and degraded land - and to eat vegan and live lighter on the land and on our own bodies with home made organic meals and no caffeine, processed foods, nor alcohol or smoke.

Plus there’s the founder’s words about the living experiment here to “ engineer compassion.”

I recommend you check things out, take a tour if you can, and then come stay here at Sadhana Forest some amount of time to feel what it’s like to be part of an ever-evolving successful international community.

You can jump right in to experience and help create a more sustainable, non- violent lifestyle and share this model of hope with the world. It is a happy thing to be at Sadhana forest, even if we have sad moments too. 🌳🤗
