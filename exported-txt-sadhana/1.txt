One should go and see this place to know it better. Some 10 odd kms from Auroville main gate, you can go and visit this place for free. A guide will accompany you and show you around for free. How they stay, cook, work and do other chores. If you want to stay you can book in advance by paying Rs. 600/day (One has to compulsorily help them in their daily routine activities and work)
