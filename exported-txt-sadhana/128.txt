Gorgeous place with wonderful people
I visited Sadhanna for two weeks this summer and have absolutely loved my stay. Everyone is welcome no matter how long you stay: volunteer for several months, come for an afternoon tour or simply eat a free vegan meal.

The community spirit here is astounding. I have never been to a place where every member of the community (even if you’re here just a few hours) is equally valued and appreciated. I particularly enjoyed the Saturday ‘potluck’, where everyone is welcome to join and enjoy a lovely meal in a gorgeous sunny setting. Meeting people from across the entire globe is enlightening and you get a true insight into the local way of life as people from the nearby villages flock to try new food and chat.

Aside from the potluck, people are free to visit at any time and will be invited in to join a seva, have a tour or have a chat. People of all ages and cultures live here long and short term, so you will always find people to relate and talk to. I have loved getting to know so many people and sharing in such a unique experience.

Whether you are just passing through for a quick stop visit or looking for somewhere more long term to stay, I would definitely recommend visiting Sadhanna forest for the delicious food, astonishing setting, friendly people and the totally fascinating way of living and feeling.
