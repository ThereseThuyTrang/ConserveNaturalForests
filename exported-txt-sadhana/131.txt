Such a wonderful place for children
I visited Sadhana Forest three or four times with my five year old daughter during my first trip in Auroville from January to March. I was quite sure Sadhana Forest was the community I’ve been searching for to live in. So I came back this August to stay for at least one year with my daughter Dora.

I have to say Sadhana Forest is such a wonderful place for children. This is a place where children are appreciated, respected and nourished. They have the opportunity to be exposed to nature and learn naturally, without being pressured. They will eat the healthiest food and unhealthy food cannot even be found here. I can see how Dora has enjoyed her living here. She has become friends with all of the other children from different countries and they can always find something interesting to do in the forest or the huts. She’s been given so much love from all the volunteers in the community. I really appreciate it very much!
