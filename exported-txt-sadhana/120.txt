Come here and try it yourself
I came to sadhana forest because I was curious what it would be like to life in a community. I was not sure what to expect. I needed maybe one or two days to acclimatize. This is not because of the basic lifestyle but more because of my lack of preparing. After the first two days of getting used to the toilets. I absolutely love this place! It is such a safe place with no competition and no judgment. Everyone can be who one wants to be.

Beside the experience of living in a community I learned so much more! I learned about being vegan. I used to have my doubts about being vegan but staying here living this close to nature and the experience of the healthy change in my body really encourages me to stay vegan!

I can go on and on about the great people and the great experiences but stop reading this episode, just come over here and experience yourself!
