Beautiful place with beautiful humans!
I went to Sadhana Forest by curiosity and I wasn’t disappointed ! This place is just amazing! First, the place is very beautiful and peacefully. The Main Hut (and the otherd huts) is incredible. Also, the people are very nice and caring. There are a lot of good vibes here!
Just one thing: you need to be comfortable to wake up earlier ... because we start our Seva at 6:00 am! But don’t worry, you will awake with some music, and the Sevas are very nice (particularly when you are going into the forest to plant some trees!).
There are also a lot of activities: you can go to the mud pool, meditation hut, tea hut or just play music with somebody at the NON-talent show.
Anyway, i recomand this place to all the nature lovers who want to share some good moments with everybody !
