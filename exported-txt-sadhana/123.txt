Adventure school trip
The place is just as described. Minimalistic living is their aim which is very efficiently being met.
People here are welcoming and warm and help you in adjusting to a sustainable life in the forest. There are several mosquitoes here but also sufficient mosquito nets covering the cots.
It may be a little difficult in the begining to adjust to the dry compost toilets (no flush) and the no tap wash basins and the toothpaste but it truly grants you a holistic experience.
