A great place to visit in the Pondicherry area
I had a great experience volunteering in Sadhana Forest this summer. From the first minute I got there, people were eager to help me and show me around. It is a great chance for solo travelers, couples, friends and families to live in an open minded community with solid core values and principles. You’ll never feel alone here.

At the beginning of the week we choose our sevas for the upcoming days, which means we get to decide what we want to do. Nobody will ever push you to do something you don’t want. I myself worked in the reforestation group (planting trees, picking up wood, mulching), I took care of the cows, I worked with wood, I cleaned the kitchen, washed the solar panels and went to pick up fruit and vegetables in the vibrant Pondicherry’s market.

Other than these beautiful activities, I had free time in the afternoons and in the weekend to explore Auroville, to swim in the mud pool or read on the hammock.

How not to mention the delicious vegan food we had three times a day, prepared by the volunteers themselves. And the night activities, social gatherings to stay together in the Indian nights.

I’m grateful for all the people that I met here and I sincerely hope to get back or to visit the projects in Kenya and Haiti.
