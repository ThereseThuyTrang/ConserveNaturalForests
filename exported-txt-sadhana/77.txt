A place for growth
I have only been at Sadhana forest for a week, but already I have learned soo much from being here. It is not only a reforestation project, but a community with a lot of love, drive and creativity. This project signifies alternative ways of living, with sustainability and well-being of all life forms as a pervasive philosophy. The direct moral feedback of planting a tree, the spiritual satisfaction of selfless work, the purity of a vegan and sober culture, the wonderful people you get to know here. It all accounts to a peaceful state of mind. Itâ€™s been a while since I felt so healthy and fulfilled.

The direct impact of reforesting 70 acres of endangered tropical forest in 16 years is huge, but even more significant is the inspiration that comes with it. Thousands of volunteers like myself stay here and learn, and tens of thousands more get inspired from visiting or learn through other channels. Sadhana is a movement, and I realise how important it is that more people hear about initiatives like this. Just being part of it is priceless and everyone is welcome.
