Must visit place in Pondicherry
My visit to sadhna forest was totally unplanned. Never heard or seen anywhere about it before but i am lucky to experience the serenity and peace that this place offers. Aiden,hailing from Britain who was my Guide, is a great person who give us the walk through the forest and the way of living of the volunteers out there. It gives eternal peace after having knowing about the way of life of the people living in the Sadhna forest. I found a great diversity of people from all around the globe like US, UK, Israil, Thailand, etc. It was really great experience. Looking forward to volunteer in the near future.
