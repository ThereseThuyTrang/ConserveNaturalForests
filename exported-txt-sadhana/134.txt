From France for 2 weeks
I came here from France for two weeks. I was hosted very well by everyone. Everybody is very sympathetic, generous, helpfull, I found very quickly my place in Sadhana Forest. Although my bad English (ahaha), people were nice with me about that.
In Sadhana, you are all the time in the nature, outside, it’s very cool. I learned a lot of things about how to plant trees, the life in community, recycling, how to live without waste. There are a lot of very cool activies with people from all around the world.

It’s very difficult to recap my visit, the ambiance of the place, so come to Sadhana Forest !! And maybe you will see us because I would like to come back some day !
