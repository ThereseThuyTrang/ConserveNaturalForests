Afforestation project by auroville
Tree planting for the advanced... The whole project focuses on afforestation of the area they manage and living in synch with nature. Trying to have a minimal impact on nature by saving water in many ways. Every Friday they organise a tour that will pick you up at solar kitchen at 4pm and take you to the forest for a guided explanation tour of the camp then an educational movie, vegan dinner cooked by the volunteers and then drop back at solar kitchen around 9pm.
Have to see them if you're in auroville on a Friday
