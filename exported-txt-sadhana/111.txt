Sadhana forest- a must visit if you're in Auroville
Being a volunteer here honestly changed my life. It has been the most amazing experience.
The values sadhana forest holds- veganism, unschooling, water conservation, alternative sources of energy, zero waste and reforestation really changed my perspective.
The sevas were a lot of fun as well and all the workshops and activities are so much fun and interesting also.
The non talent show, eco film night and vegan pot luck on Saturday are the highlights of the week.
I definitely recommend to come on the Friday tour which happens every Friday or just come as a visitor and have a meal and absorb the energy of this place.
