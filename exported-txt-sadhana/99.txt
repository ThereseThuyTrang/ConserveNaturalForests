Volunteering in sadhana forest
Amazing place with lot of energy greenery all over living in huts planting trees staying connected with environment and people.cooking in conventional way yet so yummy.for me it was best place to know ourselves more.it was model place how we can be happy without having materilistic luxuries.after volunteering in sadhana forest i was able to see world in different perception.i highly recommend this place to spend some time and volunteer there if you want to be part of change it will be an amazing experience for sure.
