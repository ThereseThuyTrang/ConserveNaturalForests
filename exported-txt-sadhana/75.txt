Inspiring place, inspiring people, life changing experience
Inspiring place, inspiring people, life changing experience. I’ve has the opportunity to visit Sadhana Forest a few times and each time I’ve been grateful for the inspiration that comes with the experience here.

Sadhana is a conscious community, made up open people who are putting their beliefs into action to make the world a better, more compassionate place. They are also actively engaged in reforestation-to combat climate change and deforestation. A stay here will expose you to an alternative (or actually better, holistic, realistic way of living) way if living:vegan, zero waste and with compassion as a core value.

The impact of the place is in the practice. They don’t need to preach, rather, by learning about the many detrimental effects of modern polluting industries, the answer seems clear. Also, it was through my stay here that I became more aware of my own consumption and it’s detrimental effects on the environment. It would be hard to come here and not experience a perspective shift. And that’s the beauty of it. Even after you leave here, the perspective shift stays: that there is an alternative way of living that doesn’t harm the environment or it’s living beings.

I’ve had the opportunity to share the Sadhana experience with college aged students, and for them the experience had been life changing as well. This is a place that will welcome all, and share the beauty of a compassionately lived life with anyone who walks through the doors.
