"A forest to grow people"
Volunteering at Sadhana Forest is a memorable experience, and potentially a life changing one. It is a volunteer opportunity where you also live as part of a very special community. It is a perfect place to work on your own sadhana, and there is a lot of support for anyone who wants it. Volunteers come together three times a day to share a healthy vegan meal, and this fosters a strong sense of community and unity.
There are occasional workshops & events... yoga, non violent communication, Tai Chi, sharing circles, etc. The founders and long term volunteers at Sadhana Forest are passionate about the ethos behind the place and you will learn a lot during your stay. There is an inspiring weekly Q&A session with the founder, Aviram.

Work is from 6am until 12 noon, with a break for breakfast. There are many options for work: you can go into the forest to assist with the reforestation work or take on one of many support tasks around the community.
One of the many excellent things about this place is that all toilets are dry compost toilets - no water is wasted unnecessarily. Some people may take a few days to adjust to the no-frills living.
There is a weekly tour on Fridays at 4.30pm followed by a film and meal - ideal if you are unsure about staying but would like to look around and learn more!
