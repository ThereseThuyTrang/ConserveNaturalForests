Hello ! Somes words to tell you my feelings about Sadanah Forest. Actually i'm here since 5 days and staying for one month, the beginning of a new experience, and already satisfy !
Satisfy to wake up in the morning and go in the forest, enjoying the nature during the fisrt hours of the day. I feel myself on good rails until the evening.
Satisfy to feel welcome in this community.
It's so easy to take part in the everyday lifes, the organisation is simple and efficient. The fisrt days were quite intense, i need more days to get used to the rythm !
I looking for the coming moments to live in this place make of love and trees !
