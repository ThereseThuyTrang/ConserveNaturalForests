You will not leave Sadhana Forest the same person as when you arrived!!!
I have recently returned to the UK having had the experience of a lifetime staying at Sadhana Forest. I am disabled and spent three weeks over the New Year with my mobility scooter living in a hut in the forest amongst the kindest and most compassionate people I have ever met. What a fantastic start to 2019 with each day bringing something completely new and exciting. Various evening talks on core values such as ‘veganism’, ‘gift economy’ and ‘unschooling’ brought about profound changes within me, especially as I am a school teacher! I found the ‘sharing circle’ to be surprisingly liberating and empowering. Despite my limited contribution due to my chronic health condition I was made to feel that I had a valuable role inspiring others with my determined approach within this non-judgemental community. Sadhana Forest was a culturally and emotionally immersive experience that has completely altered my mind-set. I have returned to the UK with a ‘can-do’ attitude, feeling so much more positive about my own future and the future of our planet which has been taken for granted. I would love to be in a position to return to this truly special and unique environment to see in 2020!
