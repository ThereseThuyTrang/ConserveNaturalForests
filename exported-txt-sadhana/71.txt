Cristiana
An inspiring vegan volunteer community
I came as a volunteer to Sadhana Forest to learn more about the projects and have more experience in living in a community.
After joying the tour they provide at fridays, you will hardly not fell inspired by the methods used in the largest vegan volunteer community in the world!

Here the philosophy and goal is to make the difference and to help the planet to become a better place.
Community, veganism, reforestation, self-sustainability, decolarization, gift economy, zero waste, seva (selfless service) and projects in crisis zones (Haiti and Kenya) are the mains words I can use to describe this place hide in the forest.

Without a doubt, it is a place of passage for those who want to visit the space, share a meal with the community, become a volunteer in the short or long term. If you want to know more about this type of project, what it is like to live in community and how to help in this real ecological issue we are facing, as inspiration in your life's space or here!
Everyone is welcomed and there is room for everybody!
