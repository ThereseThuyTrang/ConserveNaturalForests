Experience beyond words
Today is the ninth day in Sadhana Forest. I am getting more and more accustomed to living in the forest, feeling comfortable and calm. I mentioned to a friend a while ago that I was about to travel to India and I would fly to the city of Chennai. He mentioned Auroville to me and he thought I would like this area. He mentioned Sadhana Forest in particular and decided to go to India. The first stop was Sadhana Forest. I also wanted to experience life in a volunteer based community.
This is my first experience of living with a community. We have different tasks that require division of labor every day. We will get up early together, cook, clean, go to the forest to water... and so on. As long as the forest needs help, we all need help. We'll all do it together. In Sadhana you will meet friends from all over the world, just like a big family, and you will get to know everyone easily. There are different tasks every day, you will seva (selfless service) with different people, and you will also have various activities. You can participate in various workshops and activities. After the afternoon seva, you can go out and explore the surroundings, or you can enjoy the quietness and comfort in the forest. There is a mud pool if you want to soak in the water, and a library if you want to read a book. Books, meditation hut. If you want a quiet little space, you can meditate, do yoga or sleep. I occasionally walk to the Tea hut to have a cup of coconut milk chai. I really enjoyed my time in the forest, and the time will slip away unconsciously and you won't realize it. Whether you want to meet new friends, learn about their forest restoration methods, or experience group life, come to Sadhana Forest. It will be an unforgettable memory. Thank you Sadhana Forest!
