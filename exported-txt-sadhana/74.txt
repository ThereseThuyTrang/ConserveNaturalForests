Living in the future
 I do not know where to start to explain how happy I am about my experience in Sadhana forest.
From an outside look, it is already amazing : living in a more sustainable way, work on reforestation and water conservation, experimenting new lifestyle with values more respectful to the environment, to human beings and to any other kind of beings such as veganism, gift economy, non violence, unschooling. Therefore there is much to learn about all of it from the volunteers, the founder, the books...
And I was much more than that living with the community for 6 weeks. Thanks to all this inpiring values and the inspiring people attracted by the place, I learned a lot on myself, being able to take some great decision for my life because I also finally had the time to work on them. It feels to me that I can live here an healthy, happy, stress less life while doing what is needed for the environment right now.

Sometimes, I feel like Sadhana forest is almost to beautiful to exist, and I would definitely recommend anybody that feel interested by it, to come and check it out. If you are open minded and open to change, you might have one of the strongest experience of your life.
