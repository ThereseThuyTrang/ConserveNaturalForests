Peaceful and Serene
I spent a week in Sadhana Forest. One of the biggest and best communities in Auroville. Yep The best part of Sadhana Forest is the SEVA which is a Selfless service for the community, it’s an everyday activity(except weekend). After doing the SEVA for the first day I felt so good that this experience can’t be mentioned in words you have to come and stay here to understand it. The values that you learn here you can always take them back home and you will find a different kind of peace in your daily life.
