A magic place
Sadhana, it's waking up at dawn to hug and plant. It's spending at least 3 hours "eating", to share on various subjects. It's being inspired by dozens of crazy stories from long terms or new volunteers. It's discovering Auroville one afternoon here and there.

Sadhana, it's living in the forest, with the forest. Listening singing birds and biting mosquitoes. It's observing green shades and smelling wood parfume and bristle in the hut.

Sadhana, it's getting your energy level on maximum through contact with people, and with a project that makes sense. It's confronting yourself with a very unusual lifestyle, so healthier. It's living veganism, unschooling, gift economy and compassion. It's being forced to think about the future we want to live.

I have stayed there 27 days. Enough to get deep into it, develop friendship. Not enough to be bored. Everyday has surprised me, i enjoyed every moment.

This place fits my personality. Sevas, including some for the environment, and some optional workshops and activities. Mostly a lot of time with people to share and meet, deeply and in awareness. I would not stay longer for 3 reasons. First, because my journey is about new places all the time. About leaving for other discoveries. Secondly because there is a bit too many people to feel at home very long. It takes me effort to meet and especially remember peoples life. Finally because if one day i participate in creating a place like this, i want it to be in Belgium or France, not other side of the world. It makes more sense for me.

Sadhana Forest changed me. I will never forget it. I keep deep in my mind and heart a part of this fabulous place. This community where magic of the environment is as great as the people staying there.
