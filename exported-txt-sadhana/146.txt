Volunteer community!
If you ever feel like escaping the normal world, busy life, full with pressure and expectations, and to let go. This is the place to go!
Its full with really amazing, inspirational people. You are living so close with nature!
This place is great to visit, either for the day or for a short time to see the forest community! Its even better to come sty here for a few days or weeks!
