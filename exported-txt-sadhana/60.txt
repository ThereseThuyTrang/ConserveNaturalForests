Wildlife in a community
Sadhana forest is a good place to learn how to live close to the nature and in a community. Where you also learn how to take care about the forest and the animals. Moreover it's a beautiful place with huts and a mud pool.
To be more precise, here I feel that there is a real community life because we do lots of activities together and we really work for the community and not for ourselves. The place has also a deep soul which is easy to get close to, so I could feel very fastly integrated. Even if there are lots of rules, which are necessary for the community life but it took time for me to understand some of them, it's possible to get involved and have responsibilities very easily. Moreover I feel that I learn lots of things everyday thanks to the people here and I still have enough time for myself which is necessary. The sharing here takes place with all the generations, from children to aged people, and with different animals like cats, dogs and cows. Ok my free time I really love staying but it's also easy and nice to go sometimes to Auroville which takes like 15min by motorbike.
Even if the place is very clean and well organized, there are still the usual discomforts of mosquitoes and bad smells of the compost toilets. But this is part of living close to nature and being respectful of it.
Finally, here you really never get bored thanks to the library, the workshops volunteers propose, the WiFi connection, the work for the community, the visitors who come daily and the rich nature around. The food here is also amazing, it's a great place to experience your relationship with it.
