Human Oasis
I have visited several times to Sadhana forest,
The strongest impression it always leaves on me is HOPE.
Just to know that there people on this planet that realy cares and takes care of it and it's multiple habitats,
I think the sadhana forest experience is extremely exceptional and multi layers,
If Sadhana forest is possible than everything is possible.
