Must come
Had an experience of a lifetime here. Suggested by a friend, Sadhana Forest turned out to be a gem. You never stop learning here. The community is really friendly and helpful. The environment over here is peaceful and away from the city rush. Had an amazing experience doing 'seva' and got to learn many many things about the forest. Everything's well organised and planned, be it the ambience or how it works overall.
You encounter animals every now and then, the good part being that you can play with them. Cats, dogs, peacocks can be seen frequently. There's a lot to take away from here, an improved and better consciousness along with the understanding of forest and water conservation.
