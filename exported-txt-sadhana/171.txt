A wholly wonderful and immersive experience
Sadhana Forest is a gem of a community where one can truly understand how compassion is tangible and not just an abstract concept to be debated about in armchairs. The project reflects compassion towards animals through its 100% vegan food and by providing a Forest home for the insects, reptiles and birds inhabitants; compassion towards people with its environment of cooperation and collaboration; compassion towards the curious mind with its unschooling philosophy; and compassion towards the planet through the reforestation efforts directly. It's always been a pleasure to attend the tours and to see the project in action. It truly is a little slice of paradise.
