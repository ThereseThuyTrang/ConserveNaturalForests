Get To Know Nature and Yourself
Feb 2020
Sadhana Forest is a vegan, eco-friendly community that promotes reforestation. People come from all walks of life to learn how to live sustainably, support animals and plant trees. It is a great place to come to get to know yourself as you get to know people from different backgrounds. Throughout the experience, I have learned many new lifestyles habits to help, not hurt, the environment and people around me.
