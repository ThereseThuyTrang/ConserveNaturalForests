If there is one place to see in Auroville, it's Sadhana Forest!
Sadhana Forest is a reforestation and water conservation project, run by volunteers. 14 years ago a family startet this project in the middle of nowhere. Today you find a beautiful forest with thousands of birds. But there is still a lot to do. More trees need to be planted, the younger trees need to be watered and mulched and huge holes have to be dug, to keep the monsoon water on the dry land. But water conservation is not only about digging holes-it's also about using less water for washing hands and for flushing the toilets. Sadhana is also a beautiful vegan community which supports all volunteers. 2018 was my first time at Sadhana Forest, but for sure not my last time. Thank you Sadhana for letting me grow trees and also my personality.
