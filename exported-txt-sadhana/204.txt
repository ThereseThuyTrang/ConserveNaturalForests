Life-changing experience - people need to know about this place!!!
I have been on multiple tours of Sadhana Forest and am absolutely blown away by this incredible organization!!! Reforestation, water conservation, sustainable energy, vegan lifestyle, zero-waste, drug-free, ecoconscious, natural building, animal sanctuary, community life and compassion in action – these are the keywords I have in my mind when I think of Sadhana Forest. Thank you for showing me that it is possible to live in harmony with nature, animals and humans! For me Sadhana Forest is the living example of what’s possible if you take Mahatma Gandhi literally: ‘Be the change you want to see in the world’ :)
