Make a difference!
Itâ€™s remarkable how sustainable living at Sadhana Forest has converted the 70 acres of severely eroded and arid land into a beautiful dense forest. I realised how our choices matter and by just being mindful about the resources we use on a daily basis, we can make such a huge difference.

We cooked together, we cleaned the forest, we planted saplings, we sang, we celebrated every day by being grateful to what we have.
