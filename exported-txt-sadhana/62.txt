What a beautiful learning experience
Wow. I’ll never forget the moment I entered the Sadhana Forest the first Time.
I found myself surrounded by so much lovely and positive energy!! I felt life. I felt the energy of the people in terms of growth. Internally and externally. And you can literally see it. Just by looking around you. Everywhere trees. The fact that around 15 years ago there was only dust and now everything is green instantly gave me hope and inspired me in such a positive and powerful way.
I definitely knew from this moment on: „yepp - i‘m definitely in. I want to volunteer here.“

I quickly understood that here I‘m able to find a great way to grow personally and learn so many things about myself and others. About nature and our life.
Now - after 3 weeks of volunteering I can definitely confirm this.

Here you have the space to really put a mirror infront of you and to deeply reflect on your own personality and the world and what it means to live life in a community. Therefore it is also in fact a social experience. You are surrounded by so many open-minded people. You can easily talk to anybody about your emotions or what ever you‘re struggling or thinking about at the moment.
I had so many great conversations with people here. Important conversations.
I‘m so thankful for this time and experience here and will always carry this with me.

I can only encourage everybody to go and visit this place. And maybe also you will feel a connection to this place as I do.

Thank you people of Sadhana Forest.
