Sustainable living practiced - with thoughts for your own life
Dec 2019
If you are in the area, DO VISIT. Every Friday at 4pm a bus leaves 'Solar kitchen' in Auroville for a presentation + tour + communal dinner (takes about 4+ hours)

It is absolutely astounding what a few permanent residents and many international volunteers have achieved here: they reforested a barren area and the lush greens raised the water level by 6 meters in ca 16 years.
Volunteers live a vegan life, compost food, built compostable toilets, use only natural building materials - a complete circular economy. Most volunteers stay between a month or a year (there are minimums) - some come with children who are raised in a Summerhill-type "unschooling".
Everything is based on respect of nature and each other.
Maybe you cannot commit to that life (not easy) - but you can carry some of the thoughts into your own life - or support them with a donation (they do NOT ask for one at the tour.)
