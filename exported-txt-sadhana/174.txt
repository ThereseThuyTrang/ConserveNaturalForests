Wow How Inspiring to Visit this Reforestation Project.
An incredible experience also donation based, of what dedicated people from around the world have created.. This place was a desert, now its a lush forest with an ever increasing water table in this area. You get a free bus ride to and from the solar kitchen car parking area, then you are taken to the central hub in the forest for a 2 hrs talk about the reforestation project including the educational side to it..then we watching a documentary and had a vegan meal together.. The whole experience took about 5.5. hrs. Incredible value and insight to how to build a forest.
