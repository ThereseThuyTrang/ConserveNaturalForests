I have been in Sadhana Forest India for over & year now, and plan to stay stay for at least another year. This is not just a project to grow trees but to also grow people. Seeing how it has inspired myself and many people who visit on a far more positive environment and lifestyle, is great to see. A better world is possible and this place is definitely a large step in the right direction.
