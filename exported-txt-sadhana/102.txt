Happiest forest home
Jan 2020
I have volunteered for a few months at Sadhana Forest and love it more with every day I spend here. There are so many aspects of the community to get involved with and I truly believe there's something here for everyone.

The sustainable, compassionate and collaborative way of life here is so inspiring and I wish more people could learn from this place and replicate the methods all over the world. Sadhana Forest is very unique and will always be a place I call home.
