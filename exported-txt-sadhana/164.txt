One of the most sustainable places on earth you can find - must see!
I was lucky enough to be able to volunteer at Sadhana forest and I'm incredibly grateful for this experience! Sadhana is such a peaceful and soothing place - being in the middle of a forest simply calms you down. I am amazed by what they have achieved over the years and how energetically they still keep going and engage everyone around them.
The sevas I did were lots of fun and a great opportunity to get to know everyone from this diverse community better. And then the food - their vegan kitchen is just incredible, i enjoyed every meal, so you should definitely not miss out on that!
But lastly, the community I met there and got to be part of was something I will never forget - they way I was welcomed there and made to feel at home was very unique.
So, if you'd like to learn more about sustainable living in a great community - don't miss a chance to visit Sadhana or volunteer there :)
