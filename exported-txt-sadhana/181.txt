A must visit for any one!
It has been an absolutely blissful journey to be on with nature. To listen, feel, talk and be amongst nature in it's purest form. And the people at Sadhana are a pleasure to be associated with!

My son (7yrs old) who is very very used to City Life now wants to do this every summer before we do this full time.

It could be a life changing experience!
