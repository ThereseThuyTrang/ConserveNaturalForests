Tereza Tereza
Do you remember how we all used to play in the forest?
What a magical place to visit. No matter if you have 5 minutes or the whole day, Sadhana forest will greet you, give you a warm hug with its branches and stroke your soul with passion of people believing with their whole heart, that we can live peacefully and sustainably as a part of the nature. Sadhana forest is a place where people believe in true giving and they are happy to share with you delicious chai in Tea hut or any meal in the community, which is very family friendly and respectful towards children.

I strongly recommend to join Friday tour, where you will have a chance to see the forest and learn about how the community works and about it's values (like unschooling, veganism, non-violence, zero-waste, etc.). You will have a chance to eat purely vegan food, scrape your plate with ash used for cooking and crown your visit using dry toilet that is at the same time designed to be used for nurturing the soil.

You can also come and become a part of Sadhana forest just for one day and see what is the place about. Breathe and laugh with the volunteers while planting trees, see and help with the community's daily life or swim in the mud pool (which is not only one of the greatest attractions for children of all age but also a way how to capture rain water).

You can simply come and let yourself be inspired by the place and you can be sure, that once you'll come out of the forest you will not be the same person, who walked in. You will take with you a little piece of loving kindness of the people, cows, trees, birds, dogs, cats, ants, bushes, butterflies and frogs living in Sadhana forest.
