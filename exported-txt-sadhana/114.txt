Great place to walk
Dec 2019
The one kilometer walk to the viewing point was very refreshing and the upkeep of the forest was very good. Entrance to this forest is free but one needs to ask for it at the visitor's center in person.
The man who gave us the ticket looked at me and my wife - both senior citizens whether we would walk the one kilometer distance and we said we would and got the ticket. We did walk the distance and took a free ride back in one of their mini bus.
