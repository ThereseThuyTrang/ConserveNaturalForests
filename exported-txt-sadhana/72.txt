Sadhana Forest
Sadhana is an inclusive and accepting community focused on environmental conservation and sustainability. Everyone is very welcoming and makes new volunteers feel at home immediately. Since Sadhana is located within the forest, it's provided me with the greatest since of peace and quiet I've experienced since coming to India. The community's goal is not only to live sustainably, but also to change the world through reforestation as well as education about lifestyle changes. Everyone staying in Sadhana works together to reach these goals and to keep the community running. On weekdays every member participates in two "sevas" before lunch, which are essential tasks that keep Sadhana functioning. The first seva that I participated in was helping to take care of the ten rescue cows that live on the property. The cows are very sweet and basically act like extremely large dogs. They will come push their heads against you as a way of showing affection, and many love to be brushed and pet. Sadhana Forest is a vegan community, and after spending time with the cows and having conversations with many other volunteers I began to question my choice to consume animal products. Although being at Sadhana did make me think about my lifestyle choices, I never felt any pressure from the people here to take on a vegan lifestyle outside of Sadhana. Despite not being vegan when I came to Sadhana I found all of the meals delicious and filling.
