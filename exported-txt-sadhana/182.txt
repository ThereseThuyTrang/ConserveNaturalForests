A MUST to visit- the essence of AUROVILLE
If there is ONE association that I trust and beleive in with all my heart, this is the one!

They work with volonteers to conserve the water on the land, they plant trees and live an engaged, ethical, zero waste lifestyle in community.

They invite us every Friday to visit them, eat a delicious vegan meal for free and watch excellent documentaries. The bus leaves at 16h from the solar kitchen in Auroville and comes back in the evening. An other bus leaves at 18h if you did the visit already and want to join for the dinner and the movie.

A visit not to miss of you are in the area ðŸ’› loads of love and good energy ðŸ’›
