German guy seeking for a unique communal experience
Hi,
My friend suggested me a place in India that was without a doubt the best experience of his life. Me, a young, energetic guy who is always seeking for new adventures to get me out of my comfort zone, made my way to india to look for that place. Out in the forest close to Auroville there is this magical community with even more magical ambitions: making the world a better place!
So how is this exactly working?
By reforestation, veganism and zero waste (especially focusing on water)
, we are trying to raise awareness to our impact on the environment.
Me, who went vegetarian half a year ago, has no problem adapting to the vegan food, which even offers a way larger variety to what I normally eat. Being in this community definitely helps to overcome any kind of issue and makes you feel at home, even though you are at the other side of the world. There are always people who look out for you and are giving you a heart warming feeling (the morning hugs are definitely helping).
For me, this is a place of knowledge and to find myself what I really want to do in life. If you are struggling with that as much as I do, then you should definitely go to Sadhana and get a clear head.
Hope to inspire you and raise awareness of a really beautiful place on Earth:)
