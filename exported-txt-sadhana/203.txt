Wonderful Experience!
Sadhana Forest is an incredible amazing place. This community is such a good example of living a sustainable and compassionate lifestyle. It includes all the aspects from using compost toilets and reducing water waste to being vegan and taking care of cows in a cow sanctuary. Thank you Sadhana Forest for you warm, loving and welcoming community and for being a great example to many of us!
