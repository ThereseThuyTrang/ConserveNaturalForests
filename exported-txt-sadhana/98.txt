Remarkable community committed to the earth
Jan 2020
I have been staying at Sadhana Forest for 5 weeks. Itâ€™s a transformative experience that not only gives me the break I need from the city but also recharges my whole being inside out. The core values of SF such as compassion, unschooling, gift economy, non-competitiveness deeply resonate with my heart. The seeds which were planted in me long ago finally received more nutritions and water to grow.

Though community living may not be something we are used to anymore, it is truly rewarding to grow deeper connection with people from all over the world. Collaboration during seva(selfless service) is a great way to connect & get to know someone. My favourite activities are tree planting and cooking for 60+ people. Each week there are core value talk, sharing circle, non-talent show, eco film club plus many other workshops offered by different people staying here.

If you happen to be in Auroville, should definitely come check out Sadhana Forest. Swing by to have a free meal, join a seva, or even stay for an extensive time to get a full experience of this remarkable community!
