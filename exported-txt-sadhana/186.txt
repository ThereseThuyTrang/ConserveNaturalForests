An amazing place to visit in Auroville
The forest is so beautiful that it is hard to imagine there was nothing when Sadhana Forest started its wonderful work here. There is also an inspiring atmosphere between the volunteers who love to share their passion for Sadhana Forest with you and explain the project and the completely sustainable way of life: solar energy, the sparing of water resources, the local and natural construction of the huts... the overall joy and attentiveness is heartwarming and inspiring, very in line with the unity dream of Auroville.
