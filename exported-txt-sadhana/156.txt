Great project, welcoming space
I did the Friday tour which was a great experience. The tour was very informative, the guy taking us round was knowledgeable and presented the information well and in a friendly, welcoming manner.
The project itself is great and much needed, and it was nice to see and hear that so many people volunteer there, giving something back to humanity.
Overall great place, nice tour, worth going.
