Is this the real life or is it just forestsea?

This place is so amazing that I don't even know how to begin!
I saw on their website that they were only giving tours on fridays and was already sad because by then I would already been far away when I decided to just write them an email to see if perhaps something was possible anyway. In less than 24hr I got a warm reply from Victoria full of details on what their schedule looked like and telling me that they would be happy to have me any day! I couldn't believe it, next day in the morning I was there, sharing breakfast and helping in the second seva followed by lunch and a small (but exhaustive tour of the place given by Richard). In very few other occasions I felt so welcomed and part of something. What they are doing is truly amazing and it shows! Only amazing people are capable of such things. They live by what they preach and while helping mother Earth they are also really careful about the footprint we all have as individuals. Zero waste, intersectional, full of love and against every discrimination.

Loved every second I was there!
