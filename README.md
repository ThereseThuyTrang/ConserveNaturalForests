# TripAdvisor Review Extractor

## Overview
The TripAdvisor Review Extractor is a Python script designed to extract and organize reviews from a text file downloaded from TripAdvisor. The script parses each review, extracts relevant information such as review content, written date, travel type, number of contributions of the reviewer, number of likes, and personal information of the reviewer. It then saves the extracted data into a JSON file for further analysis or processing.

## Features
- Extracts review content, written date, travel type, number of contributions, number of likes, and personal information from TripAdvisor reviews.
- Ignores replies from the host to focus only on the review content.
- Organizes extracted data into a structured JSON format.
- Flexible and easy to use.

A wonderful project - great for all ages.
Dec 2023 â€¢ Family
We went with children aged 6, 9 and 12 and they all had a fantastic time - as did their parents. If you're in Pai you should definitely take the time to visit.
