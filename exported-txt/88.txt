Respect, nature and perfect moment
Extremely happy to spend the afternoon at Conserve Natural Forests. The activity happens with a lot of respect for Kamy, the pregnant elephant. The only interaction we have with her is feeding and observing her. The tour is very honest about the elephant tourism industry and answer every question. Wes is also an amazing guide to explain the project of reforestation, which we participate to by planting a tree at the end of the day. I recommand this tour to anyone who wants a respectful moment with elephant and wants to contribute to a magnificent project.
