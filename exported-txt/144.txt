Must do in Thailand
This was my first time visiting captive elephants, and I am so glad I chose Conserve Natural Forests. You know that this is a place where elephants are treated well, and your money is going right back into the organization. The elephants get to roam freely on their land, and the owners truly love them. Also you get to feed them as many bananas as your heart pleases. All in all, spending an afternoon at Conserve Natural Forests is a must do when visiting Thailand.
