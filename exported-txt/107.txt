great, eco-friendly Tour
We visited the project site in August 2018. We could spend quite some time with the elephant without forcing it to do anything like being washed or showing tricks.
We just feeded it which gave you a good chance to watch it.
We also planted trees and had a look at the tortoises.
A good half-day out which leaves you with a feeling that youÂ´ve spent money on something good.
