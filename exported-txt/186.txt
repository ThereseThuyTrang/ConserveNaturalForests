Once in a lifetime experience!
What a fantastic day!

If you want to experience pure nature and elephants in Thailand, then the Conserve Natural Forest park is definitely the place to go. The elephants are treated very well, no chains, no riding and they are not forced to do anything.

Miguel and the time involved in the project are doing amazing things!

Highly recommended!

Please note that many elephant 'rescue' organisations are not what they claim to be and do not treat the animals kindly. This place is without a doubt one of the best ones.
