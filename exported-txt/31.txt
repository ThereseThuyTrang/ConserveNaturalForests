Eco-conscious Local Conservation
Conserve Natural Forest is a local conservation NGO that allows you to give back to nature by letting you plant seeds to grow the forest even futher. Not only do they care for the plants, but the future for the animals in Thailand. Here they are rehabilitating an very beautiful elephant to be one day be released into the wild. Here the elephant is in charge and therefore no touching is allowed only looking

Most importantly conservation is the basis for every project done here and therefore this is a must tourist stop for all type of groups.
