Fantastic afternoon with the Elephants
Wow, what a memorable afternoon. Miguel and his team are providing 2 rescue elephants with the best possible care and attention in safe natural surroundings. You see the elephants up close, having the chance to feed them fresh vegetables l then watch them bathe in the river. They wander around freely.
Not forgetting to mention the tree planting and other eco activities that Miguel is obviously dedicated and passionate about.
This is definitely not to be missed.
