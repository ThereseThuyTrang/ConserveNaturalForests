Best Elephant Sancturary in Thailand
This is the one place where you know the elephants were actually rescued and are being cared for. They are never chained up and are free to roam around. You have a chance to feed and interact with the elephants as well as hear more about them. Definitely donâ€™t miss it if you want to see some elephants.
