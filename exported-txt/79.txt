Amazing & Ethical Reforestation and Wildlife Conservation Eco-tour
Conserve Natural Forests is a small NGO dedicated to the rehabilitation of domesticated elephants and reforestation efforts in Pai. They rescued a 33-year-old and heavily pregnant elephant, Kamee, from a logging company and they are habituating her to the wild before releasing her to the Casablanca Wildlife Reserve. Elephants and reforestation go hand in hand – wild elephants need habitat in which to thrive and forest growth is aided by elephant dung. Visitors have the opportunity to observe Kamee and feed her fruit & vegetables. Kamee is in charge – she stays for as long as she wants and is not compelled to do anything. There is no riding, bathing with or touching her as CNF is trying to reduce her contact with humans as much as possible. Visitors also get to help germinate seedlings for planting come rainy season. It is their goal to plant 1 million trees this year!

The tours run from 1:30 – 5:00 and there is a 1000 baht minimum donation. They will pick you up and drop you off in Pai. If you wish, Hippo will make you a spectacular lunch and Miguel will mix you a passion-fruit gin and tonic. It’s a lovely way to spend an afternoon, learn about conservation, interact with an elephant in an ethical way and contribute to the restoration of Northern Thailand’s forest (and offset your carbon footprint!). A definite must-do in Pai!!
