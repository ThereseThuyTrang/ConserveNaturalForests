An incredible day
This is a great place with a great mission. They are currently rehabilitating Kamee, a female Asian elephant so that she can be donated to one of the national parks once she has re-learnt her natural behaviours. We were lucky enough to have a private ‘tour’ where you can participate in feeding Kamee the dietary supplements (bananas/corns etc) recommended by the specialists which is an incredible experience! The work they are doing here to fight deforestation is a great cause and one that needs to be supported. Please visit if you’re in Pai!
