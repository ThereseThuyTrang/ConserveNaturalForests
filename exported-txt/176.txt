The only tour worth doing if you care.
This is the best elephant tour available. Not only is this non profit organization trying to save and eventually realese them back in to the wild, they're also planting critically endangered plants and trees in a very nice way.
They plant native trees in a way that eventually nature sorts it self out. They will explained this once your there. The whole planting part takes about 15 mins the rest of the 3 hours are spent with the elephants. They now have two pregnant ladies. One of them was to give birth in the next 2 or 3 days!! Might even be twins!!

We were so happy the whole time and everything felt so great. This trip makes all the other ones look bad in my opinion.

And also the gin tonics in the end are the best.
