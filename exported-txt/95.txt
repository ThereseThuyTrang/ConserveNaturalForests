A unique experience!
Me and my friend had a great day at the Conserve natural forest project! The staff (our guide was called Jason) was amazing and we got lots of interesting information about the project, their elephant Kamee and about elephants in general. Their elephant is treated with the greatest respect and care. You can relax there, swim in a river, enjoy a nice drink and you get to plant your own tree! I am convinced that there is no better way to spend your money in Pai! Thx again for the unique experience!
