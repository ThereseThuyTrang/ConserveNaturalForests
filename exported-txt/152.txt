Enjoyable experience for all the right reasons!
An NGO doing perfectly ethical fantastic work. Cheap price to pay for a lovely day with 2 extremely pregnant elephants and planting trees. Well informative and the founder answered all of our questions and we had a lot! Make sure to support this great cause and visit whilst your in Pai, it restored some of our faith to see elephants living happily and being cared for so well. Don't support the brutal elephant tourism of shows and elephant rides you find elsewhere in Thailand, you will find much more happiness seeing these majestic creatures roaming freely in gorgeous scenery nibbling tons of pumpkin from your hands! When we went we were in a group of 10/12 which was also great :) you can book online via their website.
