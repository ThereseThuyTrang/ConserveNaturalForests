Unforgetabble experience
One of the best experiences i have had in Thailand. A place Where you know elephants are respected as animals and not abused by their owners. Everyone should visit and donate so they can rescue more elephants and make it a better place. You can feed them you can swim and Wash them in the river what makes this experience even more unforgetabble.
