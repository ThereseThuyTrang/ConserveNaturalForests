This is the only way you should go for when seeking for a healthy and sustainable elephant experience in Thailand
Very fulfilling experience in many ways. From the very beginning to the very end of my visit at Conserve Natural Forests in Pai I felt like home. Home because, you always feel this clean, safe and extremely respectful approach towards every living-being this organisation gets in contact with. This love and respect to nature was shared openly and with passion. Informative, educative and elephant friendly day! You will plant a tree at the end of your day and feel how much youâ€™ve given only by being there. Magical place. Recommend 100%. I will come back to see how my trees are doing for sure!! :))
