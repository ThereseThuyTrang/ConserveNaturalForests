What an experience !!
Jul 2022
I had the pleasure of joining the CNF family for five weeks on an internship whereby I helped build a house for the Mahout, who look after the elephant Kamee. The foundation is a non-profitable organisation advocating the importance of our natural environment. They are currently situated in Pai but they are beginning to branch out to the south of Thailand. By supporting this foundation you will be helping fight the battle against deforestation and supporting a brand which is hoping to spread knowledge in other areas of the world.

Enjoying the eco-tour, where you can plant your own tree, and donating to the cause will help CNF achieve their ambition of creating a greener world!

If you're in Pai check it out !
