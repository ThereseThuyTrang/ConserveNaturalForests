Shakin her big grey trunk for the hell of it
Incredible project!!! My deepest respect to Miguel who started it by rescuing a beautiful girl Kamee-the-elephant and the rest of the team, everyone who participates and contributes to this project - you are amazing. Jason, our guide, was contagious with his eyes lit up with passion, telling us everything there is to know about elephants’ life and about the sanctuary itself. These people are replanting the natural forest with their own hands and let you try and do the same: every guest gets to plant and name his own tree. Truly the best example of being the change you wish to see in the world. Kamee turned out to be very pregnant, 26 months - about to give birth any second. Despite having a whole entire elephant inside of her she keeps being very graceful and extremely cute. The place is worth spending a whole day there from early morning, it’s beautiful and serene. I don’t want to spoil more - go and see for yourself!

Thank you for your passion and hard work guys.
Visit, relax, enjoy and remember!
