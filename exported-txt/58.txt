FOR NATURE
CNF is a little different than other elephant attractions. It focuses on the health and wellbeing of not only the elephant species, but of other plants and animals. They have a competent and caring team of people who are dedicated to giving back to nature while helping you experience it. Instead of using nature as a prop for instagram, the nature is better taken care of. I 100% recommend CNF over other "elephant sanctuaries". Also, its on a beautiful river you can swim in if chosen and Miguel has bomb passionfruit gin & tonics for days.
