Great organisation with a love for trees and wildlife

Conserve Natural Forests do a lot for nature! Lately they planted lots of terrestrial and mangrove trees in south of Thailand, I think around 35000 trees. The CNF team works really hard to create a greener world.
This tour is worth visiting to have a peek of what they do. You can prepare seedlings, meet the elephant Kamee, and have a look around the nursery site while CNF explains what they do and why. If you want to contribute your share for nature and if you want to have a great time in the middle of green, Book an ecotour!
