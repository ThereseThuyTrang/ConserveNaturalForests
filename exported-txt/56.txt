AMAZING EXPERIENCE/MUST VISIT
CNF is such an amazing organization! I could really tell during the eco-tour that they are dedicated to the land, animals, and community. Not only did we get to plant trees and help ease our carbon footprints but getting to feed Kamee (the elephant) bananas was a lot of fun. Highly recommend!!
