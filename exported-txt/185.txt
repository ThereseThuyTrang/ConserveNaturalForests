THE place to see elephants in South East Asia.
This is a must-see. After travelling south east Asia for 4 months we had been looking for elephant camps to see and touch (not ride, don't ever ride them) and we are so glad we waited for this amazing place. Don't expect bells and whistles and anything fancy - this place is natural and kind and simply shows you the elephants as it should be. They are free to roam and eat and interact with you as much as they want. You walk through the river and have an opportunity to wash them and feed them and just be with them. It was brilliant. And so humane. Support this great cause!!!!!
