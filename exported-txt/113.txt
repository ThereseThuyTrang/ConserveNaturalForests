Truly unique and inspiring!
I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for responsible elephant management and an eco friendly experience!!!

Before travelling to Thailand, I learned that many elephant sanctuaries are not what they claim to be, and that the elephants are mistreated and showcased for tourists. I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful treatment Kamee the elephant receives at CNF! They call her their princess, and itâ€™s easy to see why. She has huge tracts of land to roam, and only comes to her pen when she knows she is going to bed fed bananas. The other half of their mission is replanting forests, which we participated in by helping out in the tree nursery and planting a tree of our own!

This was without a doubt the highlight of my Thailand trip, and I recommend it to anyone travelling to SE Asia!
