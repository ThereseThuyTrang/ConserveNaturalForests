Must go!!
Absolutely amazing experience. I learned so much aboutâ€¦ so much. From biodiversity, to deforestation, to the reality of the life of elephants. This was a great experience. The team working there cares so much about what they do and it shows. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is coming through the area.
