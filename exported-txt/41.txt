Awesome place to visit!
There are many tourist attractions in Pai. But I can tell CNF is an authentic experience. We visited this place in September with our child and the team lovingly welcomed us and showed us not only their forest, which they planted 4 years ago. They also introduced the local plant specieses and animals. Of course, meeting their elephant in the end was A highlight. An elephant living not at a chain, walking free around and living there in peace.

Thanks for this DAY!
