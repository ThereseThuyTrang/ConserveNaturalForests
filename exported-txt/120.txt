fantastic experience at/with a fantastic project
Feb 2018
There's lots of places in Thailand that use elephants to entertain us arrogant, selfish humans and make money for the "owners" of such wise and majestic animals, but not at CNF, an NGO formed to help and heal injured elephants until they can be safely returned to the wild of natural preserves AND they are working to restore the land by replanting hundreds of thousands of indigenous trees. It's all about the elephants and what they want to do, not about them doing what we want to do....I felt so blessed to find this place where all of the folks that joined us...except a couple older Germans who were, I guess expecting a circus act who were unhappy...but thankfully left....were there to share the same experience, and we had a wonderful afternoon of heart and love and sharing, eating fantastic food, drinks, swimming, feeding kilos and kilos of bananas to Kamee, and culminating it by planting trees, to contribute to the awesome work Miguel is doing. I feel so blessed to have been part of such a wonderful experience....Thank you!!!!!!!
