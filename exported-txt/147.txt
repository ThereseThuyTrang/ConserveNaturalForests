Amazing experience
We had a lovely day here. They have two lovely elephants that you can spend time washing and feeding, in a small group of about 10 people. We had really wanted to see elephants but had been worried about places not treating the animals well so we were really pleased to find this place where the animals can walk freely without chains and aren't forced to give rides. A really special place working on reforesting the local area and protecting endangered species. Definitely somewhere worthwhile to visit!
