THE BEST SANCTUARY
This is what I was looking for. Nowadays it looks like a hype to be a sanctuary. But there are a few real sanctuaries and this is one of them.

The way they handle the animals is really good. One of the guest was teasing one of the animals by holding the food on a big distance so that the animal could not get it. The host stood up and said something about it.

These Elephants are rescued from riding tours and are cared for till they are ready to live in Elephant reservation where no tourist come.

Great Job! Keep up the good work.
