Incredible eco tours!
Oct 2021
My partner and I went for an ecotour and learned so much about reforestation and wildlife in Thailand! The CNF project site is quite beautiful, the tour takes a few hours but it passed by so quickly! It can be a little muddy so you might want to wear closed toed shoes.
We really appreciated that it was a hands off experience with the elephant and that she was able to just eat and hangout without too much human interference! It was awesome to just walk around with her and watch her be an ele 🐘🐘👍
