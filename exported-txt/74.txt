Incredible way to support elephant rehabilitation and forest conservation.
This truly is the RIGHT way to experience elephants in Thailand. Its so much more than an instagram photo opportunity with an elephant (although there's that too). Learn how elephants play a key role in the health of Thailand's forests and know that your money is going towards making a LASTING POSITIVE IMPACT on the environment and elephants here. The owner and staff/volunteers are lovely people and you are guaranteed to learn something and will most likely want to come back multiple times before leaving Pai. I definitely did!!
