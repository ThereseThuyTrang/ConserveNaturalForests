Let me be honest, I came to Pai to party and end up with an education in reforestation and sustainable development. Visiting Conserve Natural Forests is a great way to spend an afternoon while in Pai.

The tour went like this. They picked us up in town and drove us all to their conservatory which is about 15 minutes outside of town. At the conservatory, a woman named Hippo taught us about Conserve Natural Forests and their efforts to work with the local people to help reforest Northern Thailand.

Then we got to meet and feed their elephant named Kamee. They explained Kamee was there to help fertilizes the land and was not there for our entertainment. We were allowed to feed Kamee and take pictures. However, no one was allowed to ride her. I could see from my own experiences visiting so-called elephant sanctuaries that Kamee was extremely well taken care of and looked very healthy. I guess thatâ€™s because Conserve Natural Forests is not an elephant sanctuary but a reforestation NGO.

After that, they took us to their tree nursery to teach us more about reforestation in Northern Thailand and how we can off set our own CO2 emissions by planting trees. Which I thought was very interesting seeing as my carbon foot print had grown by just flying to Thailand.

Everyone got to participate in the planting of tree seeds and a chance to plant your own sapling. This was followed by an opportunity to ask more questions while enjoying a beverage. I would 100% recommend visiting these guys
