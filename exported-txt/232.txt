JUST on a mission JUST on a mission
Elephants and the environment! What more do you need?
This was an incredible day out in Pai! We drove our bikes out about 18 km into the mountains on the most beautiful winding road. On arrival at the site we were introduced to the two female (pregnant) elephants, Kamjan and Maemoon. They have both come from tourist camps were they were ridden 8 hours a day, every day. Now, they don't ride anymore! They are free to wander the land of the project site, eat when, what and where they want to. We gave them additional fruit treats and were then invited to bath them in the river. The best bit is just to be given the chance to observe them and know that they suffer no more.
After that the team at CNF explained to us their mission and goals for the future and what actions they are taking to help in the combat of deforestation, we planted a couple of trees on the land and helped in their organic garden.
It was such a special day, I won't be forgetting it anytime soon!
