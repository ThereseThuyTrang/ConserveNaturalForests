Sustainable Travel, Relaxing Afternoon
Conserve Natural Forests is THE best way to experience elephants in Thailand. You can tell Kamee is treated with nothing but respect, and the emphasis is placed on her happiness, she is free to roam and eat as she pleases. Getting to feed her bananas is a blast! CNF not only helps in giving elephants a comfortable sanctuary, but they also make a huge positive impact with their reforestation project. When visiting, you get information about the project and get to plant a tree yourself, which contributes to the thousands of trees they plant per year. All in all, you will have a great afternoon relaxing, drinking delicious passionfruit gin and tonics, eating Hippo's authentic Thai food, feeding elephants, and learning more about what it truly means to be an "eco" tourist. Highly recommended!
