Natural interactions with free elephants
This is a great way to meet some wild elephants and support a fledgling reforestation project. They are not an elephant "sanctuary" which is often just a holding tank for elephants who are still held captive and squeezed for tourist dollars. These elephants perform no tricks and roam freely in the land. The former trainers guide them to the group for a feeding and a bath but it is a very organic environment that demands very little of the animals. A great relaxing half day with the animals, great affordable food and drinks available and caps off with a quick tree planting. A great day and well worth the 500 baht!
