Incredible people and even better memories!!
Such an amazing experience where you get to see elephants, help conserve the environment all around you including planting trees, picking mushrooms, collecting data, slingshotting seeds, and so so much more! The staff were some of the nicest people I’ve ever met… Dan, a great young man and super cool dirt bike enthusiast as well as Carly, an incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic young lady taught us tons about the environment and elephants! They both also participated in every activity with all of us during the entire experience. This made my time there feel much more welcoming and like I was a member of their family not just a tourist. I highly recommend and look forward to going back!
