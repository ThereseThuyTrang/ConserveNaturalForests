Still fantastic
I've been several time in that place and they re still doing fantastic things about elephant and reforestation. The new elephant Kamee is just gorgeous. You can see how good people there take care of her. Miguel explain me all the things I asked about trees and elephants and I learned a lot. Atmosphere is just relax and you can feel they re doing the good way. I could stay ages in that place. You feel good. Thank again to Miguel, hippo, bo And the mahouts.
