Genuine experience going to a good cause
Nov 2019
This was a great, half-day adventure that felt very genuine and provided a lot of education about the reforestation efforts in the region. The day starts by riding in the back of a pick up to a beautiful location outside Pai. We are met by a friendly employee (spacing her name) who provides a history and goals of the preserve. She made a comment that she knows why everyone is here not to learn about the trees but to see the elephant, but I felt like it was super interested so I wouldnt make that assumption in the future and appreciated all the info on the fauna of the area!

The time with the elephant was super chill and genuine. Really well cared for elephant and they don't turn the whole thing into a selfi-taking petting zoo which is quite refreshing. You spend 2ish hours feeding the elephant and watching it hang out. The day ends with planting seeds/saplings, seeing their mini turtle sanctuary and drinking a wonderful cocktail by the river.

Highly recommend for a chill day in the jungle that respects the elephant on site.
