Memorable internship experience
Jan 2021
Co-operative Education at Conserve Natural Forests based on an internship period from 25th January until 14th May 2021, I work as a photographer promoting my position. I have gained skills and experienced a lot including learning Photography skills, good communication abilities and a friendly personality for creating a positive first impression to guests and finding the way for solving any process by myself. I am working as a team to improve interactive skills and problem-solving skills. Thank you and appreciate you all.
