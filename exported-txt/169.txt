WOW
By far one of the coolest experiences.
The whole thing is very casual- right from the pickup spot to seeing the elephants to the drop off. No tricks, no commands, if you stop feeding the elephants they'll walk away and no one will make them stick around.
Such an amazing day to learn about Asian Elephants and experience their amazing calm demeanor.
Planted a tree and prepared seeds for next season- it was all a wonderful experience.

Oh and the passion fruit gin and tonics aren't so bad either!!! :)
