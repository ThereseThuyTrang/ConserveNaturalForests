Sustainable Tourism
Absolutely amazing time here today and the absolute number one reason for that was that this is an organisation that cares not just for the environment and sustainability but it’s local community and resident elephant, Kamee too. We had a great time observing and feeding Kamee (when she wanted us to) - but not getting too close and respecting her space. We also learnt a huge amount about conservation in Thailand and the rehabilitation of elephants in general. We were treated to a passion fruit g&t and also got to plant a tree in the ‘demonstration forest’. They do a huge amount of community outreach and education and are doing a really great job. Even if you don’t visit please visit their website and learn a bit more about what they’re up to!
