Amazing experience!
Such an amazing experience. You are given some pumpkin at the beginning and you walk across the river to the huge, heavily pregnant elephants to feed them. You then bathe the elephants in the river and spend the last hour feeding them again. The elephants are so happy and content, it was amazing to experience. The group was quite small (around 20 people) so everyone took it in turn to feed them and take photos. The staff were all lovely and the food was gorgeous and cheap. The organisation only require a small donation of minimum 500baht which goes towards the nature and welfare of the elephants. I would highly recommend a visit, we will definitely be back.
