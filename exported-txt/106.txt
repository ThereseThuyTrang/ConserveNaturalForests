This is wonderful place to visit. It was the highlight in Pai. You can plant a tree to help the reforestation programme, learn about endangered species such as tortoises and terapins a d feed a beautiful elephant rescued from a life of misery and how she appreciates her new life of freedom. The tour is very well organised and super educational.as a bonus delicious Thai food.
