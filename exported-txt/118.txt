Great experience
Yesterday we visited the park and had a great afternoon. They will bring you with a pick up truck to the location and (we were with about 15 people) Miquel will passionate tell you about the project of rescue elephants in Thailand to give them a better home at his park. In the future there will be more elephants but right now there is one, pregnant, elephant witch will except his young one in may this year.

Then you will cross a river (water to your knees) to find the elephant and give her the candy's.... bananas! There is plenty of picture time and everything is in a relaxed setting. After this you will plant a tree to make your own little forest. The food and drinks are also very good!!
