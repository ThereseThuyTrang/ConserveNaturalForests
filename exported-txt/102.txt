Great Adventure
Before you book this trip you need to know that it's not like other elephant tours. Their main aim is to better the environment by planting trees and bringing back animal species not that common anymore. You'll learn a lot about the environment and the area around Pai. The special extra is an elephant which is in rehabilitation. You can follow it though the wild and feed it. They also offer fresh food and drinks for low prices. Only small groups are allowed once a day which makes it even more special.
