One of our best memories in Pai
I found Conserve Natural Forests on tripadvisor and the main appeal of the place was the fact that the elephants weren't chained up or forced to carry any riders. I talked my husband into going with me and we requested a tour through the website. We met them in town and followed the vans to the area with our scooter. The afternoon was incredible, we got to feed the elephants (they eat a LOT of pumpkins) and help to give them a bath. Both of them are pregnant but one was VERY pregnant (4 months overdue at the time we visited). Afterward you got to order some home cooked noodle dishes from the chef (they are delish) and have a nice passion fruit gin and tonic. At the end you help to plant a tree and the entire time you're there they explain their mission to you. The environmental protection project, as they call it, is absolutely wonderful concept. They've planted over 150,000 trees last year and want to plant 200,000 this year.
It was our last day in Pai and a memorable way to spend it. Highly recommend you going to visit.
