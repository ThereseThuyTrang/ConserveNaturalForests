A real way to support elephants
Sep 2019
This place is incredible and definitely a place to visit if you are in Northern Thailand.
A real place, with real intentions, with real nature, and real people.

An NGO that is buying elephants from fake "sanctuaries" and adapting them to be wild and handling everything on their own, before re-releasing them.

Wildlife is flourishing and you get to plant as many trees as you wish. We probably all owe mother nature.

Thank you for an amazing relaxed time and for the real impact you have for the forestation and elephants.

NB: Price is ONLY 1000 baht - which goes to staff, food, more trees and to buy and rescue more elephants in Thailand.
