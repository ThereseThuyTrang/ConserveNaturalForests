Highly recommendable project and place to visit
I visited the forest in Dezember 2018 and I was happy to find people, that really do care about the environment and their elephant. The iniciator of the organization as well as all the staff have a huge knowledge about reforestation and elephants. They informed us, that there is not enough forest in thailand at the moment to set all captured elephants free. ThatÂ´s why it is so important to invest in reforestation. They have a pregenant elephant named Camee there, which is in very good health. There is no riding, washing or touching allowed but you are able to feed Camee with bananas - se likes them peeled ;) she has all the freedom to walk around in the 80ha land and as soon as the baby is able to they will both be released into the wild.
Besides the elephant and the dschungel, flowers, nature, it is a really lovely atmosphere there. They serve good and cheap food, passionfruit-gin and tonic and you can go for a swim in the river. They organize a truck from Pai, that brings you there and back to town.
You pay 1000 Bath and after that you can come back to this place whenever you want. I came back once and I will definitly go there again. Money is really good invested there :)
