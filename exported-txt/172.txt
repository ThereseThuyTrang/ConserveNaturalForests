Wonderful experience
While we already visited another elephant sanctuary, we were convinced by the owner of our guesthouse to join him an visit this place.
The place was amazing. When we arrived they immediately made sure we received some pumpkins to feed the elephants, which were just minding their own business somewhere by the river. We had an amazing fried rice dish with a nice cool drink, shot some slingshots and had all the time of the world with the elephants. Tomorrow we are going back, as one of the elephants is highly pregnant and could go into labor anytime. Highly recommended!
