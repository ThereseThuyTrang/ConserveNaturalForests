Best experience of my life
This place is incredible. I had no idea of the huge issue of elephant tourism that is present in Thailand. This organization takes it incredibly seriously and is determined to rehabilitate elephants for reintroduction back into the wild instead of using them as a tourist attraction. They are also attempting (and succeeding) at reforesting much of the greenery in the surrounding area. Every visitor that comes is encouraged to plant a tree in hopes that the enormously depleted forest will soon come back.
The staff is kind yet transparent. They don’t shy away from the tough questions that sometimes have brutally honest answers. They really care there.
They also have a land tortoise sanctuary for rehabilitating and repopulating Thailand’s endangered tortoises.
I HIGHLY recommend a day trip to see Kamee the elephant and plant a tree. You give only a 1000 baht donation once, meaning that if you go back two days, two months or two years later, you don’t have to pay again. PLEASE GO HERE
