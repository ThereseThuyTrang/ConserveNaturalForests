Inspiring people and projects
Going to the Conserve Natural Forests project site was probably the best decision we made during our stay in Pai. Not only do you meet inspiring people who genuinely try to give something back to the damaged Thailand eco system, but you also get to enjoy the company of two pregnant elephants. When staying in Pai you should always consider helping these people out and wash some elephants!
