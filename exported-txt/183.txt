Must-do activity in Pai
I went there by motorbike, the road is scenic and the place is beautiful. After meeting with other groups, we crossed the river to see the elephants, Kamjan and Maemoon. We fed them with pieces of pumpkin, it was amazing to be so close to them and watched them eating. Later, we got a chance to wash them in the river. In between these activities, I have also tried the great food and Gin & Tonic here, really worth trying. It was great to see the elephants wandering around freely, not being trapped in a small place or giving rides. Would definitely recommend this place to elephant lover!
