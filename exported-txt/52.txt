A Meaningful Experience
To stand amidst a land that was once barren, and now turned into a forest with life vibrating through it, was very inspiring. During my CNF visit I got to meet the sweetest people, who not only treated me like family, but are also very well informed in all the aspects of environmental conservation. I got to learn a lot about different tree species, and feed Kamee (their beautiful elephant) bananas. Itâ€™s comforting to know that this elephant is treated amazingly, and is part of their family. I would definitely recommend a visit there. Beautiful people, beautiful land, and a mad gin and tonic. It was truly a fulfilling experience.
