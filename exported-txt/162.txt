Fantastic!
Had a fantastic day! The staff and mahouts take real good care of the elephants, they don't have to do anything against their will. Definitely no riding etc.
It was magical to be allowed to feed and wash big, kind and impressive animals like these elephants, one of the best things we did while backpacking through Asia!
