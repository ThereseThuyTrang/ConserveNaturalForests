Amazing experience
As my group came to the back half of our program, CNF was an amazing place to go. I had an amazing time planting trees as well as collecting data for tree research. It really gave you a hands on learning experience in the environmental science field. The facility was amazing from the small farm where they grew vegetables to the little dark room where they grew mushrooms. We even got to see an elephant roam around the property eating many plants. If you are also big on sustainability, CNF is also the place to go. They will teach you about certain plants and berries that you can and canâ€™t eat in the area all while taking a beautiful hike in the vast forest in Pai. After foraging, you can try the freshest water that you can drink which the guides had set up using bamboo tubes from a small creek. All the guides really know what they were doing, they were all great in making sure you knew how to do some something if you were unsure. Our leaders Carly and Dan were great in answering all our questions as well as teaching us everything to know about CNF and the wildlife around us. They really give you so much information about the nature you are preserving. If you are going into the area, you should definitely do CNF, it is an unforgettable experience.
