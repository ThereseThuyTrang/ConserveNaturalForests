Great experience!
If you want to meet elephants and their wellbeing is still your biggest concern this is the place for you. The atmosphere is super relaxed and everybody is very nice and easy goiy. Still you immediately see the passion these people have for their project. If you have a question you can ask any time. We got the chance to ride in the back of a pickup truck, meet and feed a lovely elephant lady, learn a bit about the reforestation and wildlife conservation project, saw some turtles and planted some trees. All in all a wonderful afternoon! Thanks a lot! :)
