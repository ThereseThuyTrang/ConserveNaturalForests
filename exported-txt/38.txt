CNF
A very interesting and inspiring place with great staff that are very engaged and knowledgeable. You get to see the project site, plant trees, meet their animals and maybe taste the delicious gin and tonic. If you are interested in evironmental issues and find it inspiring and comforting to meet other people that also do this is the place for you.
