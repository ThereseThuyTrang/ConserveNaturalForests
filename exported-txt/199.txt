Life changing experience
Going to Thailand is amazing..but forget the big Beach parties.. Pai in meahongson is in the north above Chiang Mia ... Thailand saved my life..lost weight with charm chai ... But Conserve Natural Forest saved the rest..really opened my eyes to the beauty of northern Thailand...though their focus is restoration of Forest and land..they restored my faith with two amazing beautiful elephants mother and daughter and both pregnant..getting these girls have been a highlight in my life...no tourist riding or tricks...just two of the most amazing animals in their own sanctuary.. free to contact you if they want..on their own terms...not a commercial environment but I did get lunch on my visit and share fruit and time with the girls.. and they can eat a lot of fruit with both being pregnant.. please see the wonderful things going on there...it will change your life and your view of the world...as things seem to get worse in the world rest assured some people are working very hard to make it better...
