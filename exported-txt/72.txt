Make sure you visit CONSERVE NATURAL FORESTS in Pai, Thailand .
This is such an uplifting place. Everyone trying to make a difference for the elephants and forests. It is a great elephant conservation project. I didn't know much about
elephant conservation before I went and I learned so much. Elephants are very intelligent and sensitive creatures. They have so abused in the tourist trade and made
to do hard work that damages their health and leaves them in chronic pain. This place
is a god send to them and educating the public about them. The tour was very educational, the guides were excellent and obviously loved what they were doing.
So nice to see people helping the elephants. Everyone should visit this place if they
get a chance.
