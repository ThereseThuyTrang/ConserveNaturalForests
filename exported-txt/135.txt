Amazing experience for the kids
Jan 2017
We totally amazed by the experience. Our kids get to be with the elephants for a long time since we drove there ourselves. And what made the whole experience more was the tree planting at the end. We planted 4 trees on the new year eve, and 4 more on the new year. Marking our green new year!
