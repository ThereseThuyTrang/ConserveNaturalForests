Amazing to see happy elephants
We were told to go here from some friends and we're so glad we did. Rescued from a company who made these two beautiful giants carry tourists from hours everyday, it was amazing to see how their lives have been transformed. It's really clear The owner and employees really care for the animals. A must do in pai!
