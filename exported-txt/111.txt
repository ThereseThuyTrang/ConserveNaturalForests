Amazing experience!
Definitely THE spot to experience the real and right way an elephant should live and be treated. You get to know about Kamee, the nature and reforestation, plant a tree and the people who work there are amazing! Super friendly and happy to answer all your questions. The Pickup truck is also a very nice experience! Nothing to complain, would definitely recommend!!
