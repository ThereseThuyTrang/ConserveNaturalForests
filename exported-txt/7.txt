It was great to come back
I came back to CNF this year and it was nice to see all the improvements and especially the botanical garden, which is beautiful. There are tortoises at the moment waiting to be big enough to be released in the national park nearby. Planting forests is still a strong activity with thousands of trees planted in different areas in the past months. And the tour is always a nice opportunity to spend an excellent afternoon whilst staying in Pai.
