The truck never came to pick us up from the meeting point!
We wanted to visit the conserve the 11th of May and arranged everything online. We had to wait at the meeting point at 13 o’clock. We are always a bit early and waited there. At 13 o’clock the girl said it would take another 10 minutes because the other guests had not arrived yet. Ok no problem. 30 minutes later we were still waiting in the 38 degrees heat. Still it was not sure how long it would take. We left because we have better things to do in our holiday than wait in the sun. It’s a pity. I don’t know if this is what they mean with sustainable tourism, but it does not work for me.
