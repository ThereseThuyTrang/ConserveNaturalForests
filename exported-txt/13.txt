Support reforestation efforts in Thailand
Dec 2022
We had a fantastic experience on the tour! Hippo, our tour guide, described the organizationâ€™s reforestation efforts in Pai. She discussed how the land used to be garlic and soy farm, but ever since the organization started planting lots of different trees, it's since turned into a rich, biodiverse forest. We saw a lot of butterflies and birds, and Hippo said sometimes there are monkeys.

We also visited a lot of different spots. They have a butterfly garden, a mushroom house, and a botanic garden. Then we walked through the demonstration forest, where Hippo explained the different trees they've planted. We also prepared papaya tree seedlings for planting. People can donate to the organization to offset their carbon footprint since the organization uses the funds to plant more trees.

Near the end, they gave us passion fruit drinks while we watched their elephant Kamee roam around. You could tell she was really well taken care of! It was fun watching her enjoy the bananas, her afternoon snack. This is a good place to see an elephant ethically

Overall, I would highly recommend the tour. Hippo and the other staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We could tell they care a lot about the project.
