What a blast!
Getting to meet Kamee, spending time with such great people in a mind blowing environment enriched with the best food and unforgettable passionfruit gin and tonic...all in all being part of this, even for just few hours, was truly a blessing. What CNF does here is admirable and it's easy to tell the value and sincerity of their project walking through the forest and witnessing the great life they give to Kamee.
