Absolutely lovely way to spend an afternoon, while supporting a good cause
Conserve Natural Forests provides an extremely relaxed and really enjoyable experience. They are primarily focused on planting trees to help the damaged ecosystem in Thailand, but also in assisting endangered species. You give a donation of 1,000 baht to visit, but they very kindly insist that this means you can return again at any time for no cost.

They currently have one elephant, who is very pregnant and very happy. The visit mostly involves feeding her and spending time with her, as well as chatting the to extremely nice folk who run the place. They are doing important work to help elephants who have had tough lives- the current elephant was previously in a Burmese logging camp.

If you are looking for a way to spend time with elephants where you have absolutely no concern for their wellbeing, then this is the place to go! I highly recommend
