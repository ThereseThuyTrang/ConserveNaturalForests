Magical place
I am very skeptical about places where elephants are seen on farms. But I was there and saw it for myself. It wasn't not like a tour! The elephant would get out of such cruel "elephant riding" or "elephant sanctuary" tourist tours.
You do not ride on the elephant or take her to the water to have a bath with her.
You can feed the elephant, but only if it feels like it. She was so happy when se cames out to see us. She felt very comfortable with us and looks very healthy.

But it isn't only about the elephant. We planted trees, which is beautiful and extremely important for the world to plant more trees and keep it green! If you want to do something good for the environment, if you're traveling in Thailand, visit this place. Especially in Thailand, we use so much plastic, if you're on holidays or traveling try to give the world something back. Take care of our environment. 🙋🏼‍♀️
Visit this place and plant a tree and see the beauty! 🌱

It is all donation based. I found out about it because I met someone who helps and works there.
