Ethical and informative -- a must-do!!!
Conserve Natural Forests is the first place I've been in Thailand where the elephant is actually treated well and will eventually be released into the wild. It was so interesting and inspiring to learn about their work with forests as well. We got to see their forests and even plant some trees on our own. The people at Conserve Natural Forests care about what they do and their mission is so important. They had some pretty great gin-and-tonics with fresh passion fruit, too!
