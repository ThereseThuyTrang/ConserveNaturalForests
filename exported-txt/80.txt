Remarkable Elephant Eco-Experience!
Conserve Natural Forests offers an elephant experience that is unparalleled to any other elephant camp. Many people come to Thailand with the wish to see one of the greatest animals to walk the earth, but are blinded by the tourism sites available. Conserve Natural Forests is one of the only few to offer an authentic and natural elephant habitat that give tourists a chance to get a true taste of South East Asia. Spending a day with Miguel and his team will change your perspective towards animal care and how elephants live in nature. You will be amazed at what you get yourself into during an afternoon in Pai, Thailand!
