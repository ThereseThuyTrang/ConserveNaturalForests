Amplifying Positive Environmental Impact
Aug 2023
I came to do an internship here as a student of forest engineering in order to learn as much as I could about Thailand's tropical forests and ecosystems. However, being a part of this amazing team and witnessing the amazing work they do has taught me so much more than just the basics of this topic. I gained a lot of knowledge about the forestry problem that Thailand faces as well as the various strategies this organization has implemented to contribute to the solution. This organization is indeed working very hard to restore the ecosystems of once-healthy and intact forests. After ten years, the results of the reforestation work done by this organization on plantation grounds are already spectacular, demonstrating the potency of their Framework Species Method replanting technique. Not only have I enhanced my understanding of the various environmental issues that touch this country, but I have also gained significant insights into the diverse range of solutions that exist. Being a part of this NGO's work has truly been an honor, allowing me to contribute and learn in meaningful ways.
