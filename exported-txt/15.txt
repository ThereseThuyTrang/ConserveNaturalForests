Cnf is a starting organisation with big plans to expend. The tour is very educational and gives the visitor a more clear view about what CNF does. They show intrest in explaning what the do and why its benificial for the nature in thailand. Instead of only getting the touristic view CNF tells the real story of elephants and nature in thailand.
So its worth booking a ECO-tour.
