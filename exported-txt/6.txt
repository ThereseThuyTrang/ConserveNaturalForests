Beautiful organization and incredible project!
Revisited this amazing organization this year. They're just as incredible as ever!

Always growing. Always learning. They have a huge enclosure for their endangered land tortoises now, and they've built a stunning Botanical Gardens on-site. They're building this out more.

The elephant is just as gorgeous and healthy as ever. The staff are happy and doing well. And the trees just keep growing!

Super excited for their future and to visit again sometime soon!
