Most natural awesome little gem
A-M-AZING place, a MUST see around Pai! Why? Because it's about the only natural environment for an elephant in this area of Thailand (the elephant, Cami, is also pregnant and very charming to feed bananas to)!
If you like pure nature, river, flowers, trees... This is a beautiful spot. Plant a jackfruit or tamarind and help the planet mop up dirty fumes yay ðŸ˜ƒ
Staff are super sweet and passionate about what they do... Any questions are gladly answered too.
