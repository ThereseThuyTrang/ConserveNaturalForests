Wonderful Touch of Nature
Beautiful place, beautiful people, and Cami is a gem. Good luck with the baby elephant on the way. A great escape until nature and way to give back while traveling and enjoying the beautiful mountains of northern Thailand. They deserve all the love and support in the world.
