A MUST DO!!!!!!!
Best activity to do in Pai! The most incredible afternoon ever! An amazing opportunity not to be missed! I couldn't believe how incredible CNF is. Like many people who are wary of tourists traps, I was rightly skeptical of a lot of NGOs in Thailand but can honestly say I feel so lucky to have experienced such a genuinely amazing project. CNFs sole focus is to conserve wildlife and reforest Thailand the right way. Miguel, Hippo and the mahouts involved in the project are amazing. Upon arriving at the beautiful land you can see the fantastic methods of conservation being used all around you. Then suddenly you are greeted by two of the most beautiful and currently very pregnant mother and daughter elephants returing from frollicing in the protected mountain jungle. I have always been cautious of engaging in anything elephant related in Thailand and sadly thought i would never find a genuinely 100% ethical project until CNF. These rescued majestic beings are now completely free to live the life they should. No riding, controlling in any form, restraints or chains just free to do as they please, how it should be. Spend the afternoon feeding them, getting to know their adorable personalities and even bathing them in the river to cool off! Another fantastic moment at CNF was planting endangered tree species, seeing the protect the tortoise project and learning about the importance of correctly reforesting the sadly dwindling thai jungles. Not to mention Hippo does amazing food and Miguel makes a fantastic G&T or sangsom to enjoy in between the action. Simply a must! I cannot reccomend this experience highly enough. I never review on tripadvisor but had to take the time to write this review of the most brilliant NGO experience of my life!
