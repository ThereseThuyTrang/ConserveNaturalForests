Most wonderful day
We were looking for a chance to see a happy elefant in nature and this was the perfect place. There is one elefant at the moment and a reforestation program of the whole 80000qm area. They know so much about the natural needs of elefants and their behaviour. Also they teach you a lot about the tropical forest trees, which they cultivate. And as an add on you can find a really remote nature place there to enjoy
