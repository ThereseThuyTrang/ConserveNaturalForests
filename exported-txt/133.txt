Fabulous day with elephants in the middle of jungle!!!! :-D
Beautiful place, surrounded by a beautiful jungle environment
(in reconstruction)
in which elephants are at liberty, which can be observed in their daily and natural activities, which include the use of natural tools (rams, leaves) to meet their needs such as stripping a fruit from its shell or simply scratching using a branch.

you can also see the different native species that were previously eradicated to promote cultivation, and that today the foundation cultivates so that the restoration of natural forests is possible.
all this provided with a detailed and extraneous explanation of Mr. Miguel, responsible to promote and promote the project.

In the framework of this dream scenario, there is a river, which not only makes the view even more pleasant, but allows you to swim in it, and is the perfect environment to relax and relax, surrounded by true wildlife.

They also have a small menu to eat authentic food of the region, as well as drinks and refreshments.

All of the above, together with the fact that we are supporting the foundation, make this "jungle day" one of the best activities to do in Thailand.

And by the way...about "write a book, plant a tree and have a child", you can check from your list "planting a tree" , as much you want :D
They teach you to do it, in the right way and for the right purpose !!!

no doubt 100% recommendable
