Fantastic afternoon
I rode my motorbike,found it easy enough,about 20 minutes from Pai,but if you go on their website: (conserve natural forests.org )you can arrange to be picked up in Pai town and driven there...there is a 500thb donation per person,which I thought was a reasonable price...very friendly staff,they start of by telling you what they do and what their aims is,then they walk you down river to find the elephants,there are 2 at the moment,1 of which is pregnant.the elephants roam the land and are Not chained up or hit with sticks\poles.you get to feed them food and walk with them to the river then help wash them,a very pleasant afternoon.....they serve hot and tasty food and sell drinks,all of which are sold at very reasonable prices.....as they are a Forrest conservation,you get to plant a tree each and the staff explain why they are doing this.....I had such an amazing afternoon talking to the staff and feeding and being with the elephants,they are such wonderful animals and this organisation is doing a fantastic job.....when I am back in Pai I will be.....thank you very much,I had such an amazing afternoon ,you are doing a fantastic job
