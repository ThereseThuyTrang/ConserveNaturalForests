Amazing
At Conserve Natural Forest we planted a tree to add to the tree nursery. There were two elephants that had been rescued from riding camps. We fed the elephants fruit and gave them a bath in the river (amazing!) Once out of the water we warmed up by the fire with a big bowl of noodles and watched the elephants wondering around. The experience was absolutely incredible and I would encourage anyone who wants to see elephants to do it here. By not riding the elephants at the camps youâ€™ll help to make it a thing of the past.
