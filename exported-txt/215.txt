Amazing way to interact with Elephants
I simply can not recommend Conserve Natural Forest's enough, it was a completely amazing experience from start to finish and a real education into the insight of what tourism has done to the wildlife industry in Thailand.
You get to see and interact with the elephants in there natural habitat, we got to feed them and bathe them, the staff where incredible, they spent time with everyone, we got fed amazing food during our visit too.
You will not be disappointed if you visit this wonderful reserve, their purpose and passion for what they have achieved are truly inspirational.
