Relaxing and interesting afternoon activity
I like the mission of the CNF. After being picked up in town, we walk some metres through the forest and received info about plants, animals and their actions which are impressive. The tour was not too long and afterwards we spend time there with drinks and snacks. We also watched the elephant eating snacks. It was a friendly atmosphere and I enjoyed the afternoon there.
