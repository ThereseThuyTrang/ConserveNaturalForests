Ethical NGO, informative & genuine!

CNF is founded and run by people with big hearts & a genuine passion for the environment. Their elephant Kamee is a sweetheart, and they look after her tremendously well. This is the place to go to have an elephant experience that doesn't impact the wellbeing of the elephant :) I learned about reforestation, the history of elephants in Thailand, and their rehabilitation process with Kamee. Highly recommend!
