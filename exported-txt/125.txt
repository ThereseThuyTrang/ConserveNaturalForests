Amazing!! Had to go twice and wish I had time to go again!!
We had an awesome couple of days here with Hippo, Miguel, Kami and the mahut.
We went on a Saturday and it was a group of 6. The experience was very humbling so we returned the next day!! Kami (the elephant) is a beautiful calming creature to be around. We loved her! She is also pregnant so this was amazing to see!! Sheâ€™s just like a human in that she is moody with her pregnancy but VERY VERY well looked after with her own playground and treated very well. No riding!! You do what she wants to do!
Hippo & Miguel are fantastic hosts and you come away feeling blessed with this experience. Due to the fact there is only one elephant, it feels very intimate. You get informed on deforestation and plant your own tree which is a nice way of rounding up the day! I will return if I come back to Pai and will follow on Facebook for the birth of the baby elephant! Thank you for the wonderful experience. A highlight of my trip thus far!!
