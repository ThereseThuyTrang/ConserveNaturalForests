A must see experience in Pai
I've gone and experienced the Conserve Natural Forests Sanctuary many times in Pai and have loved it each and every time. Glorious food is put on for you. You can feed the elephants, go swimming in the river with them and just hang out in a relaxed environment enjoying these big ol fatties lumber around. It's an ethical and fun environment and such a unique and rewarding experience. I haven't experienced something like this the way I have done here in Pai. Miguel and Stephan along with everyone else who is involved put in such a great meaningful effort that make what the place so much better. A must see if you are visiting Pai or if you just want to experience seeing the remaining elephants of Thailand the right way. The G&Ts are also fantastic. Can't wait to go again!
