BEST PLACE ON EARTH
Seriously go here. This place is amazing. The people. The land. The elephants! The food and drinks. This was one of the best days ever. Planting trees. Feeing elephants. And meeting amazing people that give everything to help the environment. I am so grateful for this beautiful slice of heaven on earth.
PS. Thanks Miguel!!!!
PPS. When we went in January the babies were not yet born...but one mama was very preggers.
