As advertised
If you read their website, the visit consists exactly of what they say it will. This place is primarily about helping to return parts of Thailand to their natural state of bio diversity, both in terms of flora and fauna, with an emphasis on trees. Cami the elephant is an amazing part of the experience, and she is just that, a part of the experience as opposed to her being a tourist attraction. She comes and goes as she pleases, and is eating constantly! On our trip she was constantly near by while we learned about elephants in Thailand, reforestation, and other community initiatives. Very different from an elephant show, ride or photo op - in my opinion much better, as it felt like we got to spend time with her, on her own terms. Our kids had a blast, and it was a great afternoon.
