Amazing educational day with elephants and trees!
We had such a great experience with Conserve Natural Forests. After a 30 min drive through the mountainous forests of Northern Thailand we arrived at the project site. Greeted happily by Kamjan and Maemoon, the two pregnant elephants, that were obtained from tourist camps. The elephants look very content while just walking around, swimming and constantly eating. After our interaction with the elephants the CNF team explained the importance of forests and how to go about restoring tropical forests. We even planted a few trees and prepared some seedlings for next year's planting. Apart from the activities, the local chef, Hippo:), prepared us a delicious meal upon request. I highly recommend visiting Conserve Natural Forests.
