Peaceful day, very nice people. If you only did one thing in Pai...
The elephant actually stayed after we finished feeding her banana to hang out with us. while chatting around the table she was enjoying her meal of cane grass but also coming over to sniff us out and say hi. You know she is loved here and that this is the real deal. Planting a palm tree at the end of the visit was very relaxing and took two minutes. I named my tree 'kasi suli' meaning strong plant in toki pona. They practice a special method of reforestation where they mix varieties of plants together instead of using a mono-culture. They also use the elephant poop as fertilizer so its a very synergistic holistic place. If you only do one thifng in Pai, this is obviously it. Miguel and Hippo you two are rockstars. To 1 Million trees!!!
