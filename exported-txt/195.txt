Beautiful Experience
Where do I begin?! This NGO is changing Thailand for the better. We could see Miguel's (the owner's) passion for the land and wildlife. They are helping and healing the ecosystem through reforestation, conservation, and a lot of love.

My boyfriend and I had been looking to spend time with HAPPY elephants during our time in Thailand but are on a tight budget, and at 500 Baht/person this was by far the least expensive way to do it. Miguel rescued this mom and daughter elephant duo from a tourist facilitation where they were worked daily, and provided them land where they have learned how to be free elephants. Now they are both pregnant and will bring baby elephants into a harm-free world.

We also planted a couple of trees! We could purchase delicious food and drink. We learned much about the elephants and land. We bathed the elephants in the river. We were picked up near our hostel and dropped back off there at the end of the day. Also, those who give a donation are welcome back anytime free of charge. So great! Truly magical day. Please don't hesitate to support this organization.
