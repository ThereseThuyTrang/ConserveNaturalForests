OMG.. If you're in Pai you have to do this..!
Such an awesome experience..!
If you’re planning a trip to Pai, visiting Conserve Natural Forests is an absolute must..!!

I have been out to Conserve Natural Forests (CNF) quite a few times now and every time the experience is absolutely beautiful.. The reforestation program gives so much back to the environment and I am delighted to be able to stand back and say to myself.. “I planted that tree and, that one, also that one!” ha ha..

The elephants have taken my heart..!
During my time here I have had interaction with numerous Asian elephants and have felt wonderful powerful energy from most but CNF elephants (in my opinion..) outshine them all..
At times I feel like I’ve been invited right into the realm of the elephants.. They roam free..!

I have come to know the CNF crew very well and love their continual striving for improvement, the educational land development program, elephant liberation and strong passion for the project as a whole..

I highly recommend a visit to CNF..!!
