Excellent Experience

This is a wonderful project with great objectives. Miguel (CEO) speaks so well about the tree planting and elephant care that they do. The elephants are so well cared for and live in their natural environment. It was so wonderful to plant a tree with my young son. Such a great afternoon, spent with lovely people doing a great job. I highly recommend this. Go there!
