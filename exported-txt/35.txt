Great experience and a REAL ethical way to see an elephant
Highly recommend this afternoon our to learn a bit about reforestation in Thailand, more specifically the north. We had the chance to learn a bit about the plants and trees used along with helping to plant some trees ourselves.

We were also lucky enough to meet Kamee the elephant and have the opportunity to feed her. Having spent time at other elephant 'sanctuaries' I can vouch that this place really is ethical... All your interaction with Kamee is on her timetable and is for her benefit, not yours so no washing and and mud baths, just you feeding her some banana and passionfruits, which is funny to watch.

Finished off with a delicious passionfruit mojito it was a really lovely afternoon.
