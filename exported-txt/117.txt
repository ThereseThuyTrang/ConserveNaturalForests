Unexpected circumstances, but wonderful experience still
On route with the pickup truck we found out that there was a forest fire around the site, and they informed us immediately that the day would not be a usual one. We thought of it as a special experience and took our chances, also to be there helping in any way we could. Their work focuses on caring for their elephant Kamee, and whatever happens, she and her wellbeing is their priority. So the "usual" activities that normally went on for the visiting donators (like us) would include feeding, bathing, and/or whatever else was on her schedule, meaning whatever she wanted to do. We were happy and honoured to be able to meet her, even though the circumstances almost didn't let us, and the staff at CNF gave us a lovely experience in the end.
Some of the visitors in our group didn't understand the bigger picture when they were told that the time spent with Kamee had come to an end, which was sooner that usually. They reluctantly threw their one-time donation in the hands of the staff, and left complaining about the absurdity they had been forced to "deal" with. It was very disrespectful and sad to see that they couldn't realise that what they, and every visitor, gets to be part of when donating to CNF. You get to help improve the life of a majestic and gentle creature, plant trees, get inspired from and learn about the work being done by the staff at CNF. Not only that, but you also get to come back in the future if you'd like, no additional donation necessary.
We had a wonderful time, and we are happy to support them.
