Incredible Place with the highest values and integrity. Best place in Pai
This organization is looking after everything from reforestation to animal repopulation. It is a non-profit organization that values the environment and animals above all else. It is a non-profit organization that is mostly self-funded. With their own money, they buy previously abused pregnant elephants, rehabilitate them, and then release them and their children back into the national parks. Extremely motivated and educated on all aspects of everything they're involved in. Great for families. Extremely wholesome. One of the best experiences I've ever had.
