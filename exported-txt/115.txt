Inspiring project, these people deserve respect
Greay project, initially focussing on reforestation which is already great, but they also focus on reproduction of endangered wildlife in order to set them free. They have mostly 1 or 2 elephants saved from labour and abuse, and they learn the animals how to survive and live without humans. In the end they are released in a safe environment, completely free from humans. They also have projects with birds, frogs, turtles, but these projects depend on when you visit. Don't expect a show or forced interaction with the elephant. Normally the elephant always comes to eat bananas but they are free so they can come late or they can get sick of it after an hour and return to the jungle. This was the case for our visit, but it is such a great project we were happy to donate more than expected. If you hope for the best for the animals, this is the olace you should visit!
