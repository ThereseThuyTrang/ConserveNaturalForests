best place in Pai
I ve been twice in this week at the conserve natural forest place.
i know pai for a while and i just discover my favorite place.
The way how hippo and Miguel think about nature, forest and elephant is just perfect.
I had great moments watching and learning about elephants, around really nice people, best thai meals ever and relaxing bar.
you re doing the good way guys, keep going.
