Amazing.
Fantastic. A must see when in the Chiang Mai/Maehongsong region of Thailand. A refreshing change from the typical elephant riding camps which are so common in Thailand. No elephant rides hereðŸ˜Š The elephants here are free to roam in lush undergrowth, complete with a river where they can take a dip. Miguel, Hippo and volunteers do a great job planting to aid reforestation in the area, and Hippo cooks a great meal for visitors in the riverside kitchen. Amazing experience. Visit and DONATE to a great cause, unique in Thailand.
