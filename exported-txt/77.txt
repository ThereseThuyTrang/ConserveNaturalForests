Highlight of my trip.
Visiting Conserve Natural Forests was one of the best trips I've experienced so far in Thailand, out of five years of frequent visits to the country, and is a must-do for anyone hoping to find out more about the region's ecology while contributing to a worthwhile cause. The CNF team are extremely knowledgable about both reforestation and wildlife conservation, and it's clear that the Pai community are proud to host such dedicated NPO in their town.

While CNF isn't an elephant sanctuary per se, it is the best place in Northern Thailand to see an elephant up close and personal, and one of the only places I'd feel comfortable knowing the beautiful creature is being cared for as well as humanly possible - bordering on spoilt! There's a 1000THB minimum donation for entry, but this lets you come back as many times as you want, and it's a more than fair price for such an entertaining and informative afternoon. I also loved how easy it was for my friends and I to book the eco-tour through their website and arrange to be picked up in town and taken out to their land, all free of charge!
