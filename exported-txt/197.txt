Awesome time, Great mission
This was an awesome way to see elephants for the first time, as put by the owner (i forget his name), this was not meant to be a tourist destination. He has the elephants out of his pure love for the animal and his desire to help them as a species. Conserve Natural Forests is an amazing organization that hopes for nothing but to improve the natural environment of Thailand and the elephants who call it home! Very fun, cool way to interact with the animal. + One is about to give birth any day now!
