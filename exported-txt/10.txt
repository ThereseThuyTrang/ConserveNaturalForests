Exceptional ethical conservation park you must visit!
Absolutely incredible experience. If you’re interested in visiting a sanctuary but questioning the ethics of each one, then this is the one for you. Miguel has created an example of what a non profit conservation park can be. Everything you could be doing, he is doing. From creating fertiliser out of elephant/cow poo to hiring ethnic minorities and paying them more than a living wage to planting 300-400 thousand trees a year. He has mangrove, coral and sea grass restoration projects beginning which is exciting! The experience was amazing, we were shown the process of fertiliser making, mushroom farm and lots of endangered plants. The interns here teach local school children and give them food. Their beautiful elephant Cami is being allowed to roam free in preparation for hopefully being released into a national park. We had organic passionfruit g&t’s on the house and snacks as we watched the elephant have hers. This is a gem for nature/wildlife/conservation lovers. If you want an ethical, local conservation project then come here!!! Your money is worth every cent!!
