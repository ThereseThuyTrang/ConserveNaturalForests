We had an amazing experience visiting the Conserve Natural Forests site. Miguel and Hippo are so lovely and accommodating, they are truly two of this worlds most selfless people doing amazing things in northern Thailand to bring back an ecosystem that has been lacking for years. The reforestation program is hands down one of the best I’ve ever seen and their dedication is second to none. It’s reassuring to see people who want to make a difference on this planet and the whole crew at CNF is doing that and much more here! Our guide Suchana was really great and she taught us so much about the history of elephants in Thailand and how devastating the illegal logging was for the country in previous years. And then there’s the elephant! 🐘 Kommee is an amazing animal who deserves to be treated like a queen! The pregnant Kommee is ready to give birth any day and just being in her presence was an absolute gift. If you want a once in a lifetime experience with a good lunch and great people then you must visit the farm at CNF. Thank you so much for opening our eyes and making a huge difference guys!! Love all of you! And Kommee of course! 🐘❤️🙏🌴
