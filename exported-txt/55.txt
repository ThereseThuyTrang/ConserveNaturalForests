Incredible Experience!
This is such an amazing organization!! You get to go to their demonstration forests and see how the land is growing back after being deforested and then plant trees to help. They talk a lot about conservation efforts in Thailand and are very knowledgeable. Itâ€™s really great to see an organization so involved and doing great things to help out. And of course meeting and feeding Kamee the elephant is incredible!
