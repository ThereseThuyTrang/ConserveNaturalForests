The ONLY place to interact with elephants.
This place is the only legit elephant and forest conservation area to visit. Period. Both elephants (mother and daughter) were pregnant which is the whole idea...repopulation. They own the land, so the elephants can roam free and eat and bathe in the river. No pens, no chains, no riding or work. We got to feed them and get in the river with them and help these amazing creatures bathe. Lunch and drinks were provided for a nominal fee and we made a suggested donation of 500 BHT..so worth it. After hanging out with the elephants we were given three trees each to plant to help reforestation efforts which was awesome. They provided transportation from Pai for us and back as well. A MUST do while in Pai.
