Ethical, educational, amazing
CNF is a fantastic place with amazing vision and ethics. It was fantastic to get so close to an elephant and also great to learn about the different reforestation and education initiatives that are being run. Would recommend to anyone looking for a genuinely ethical elephant experience.
