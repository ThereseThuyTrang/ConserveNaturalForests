Dream come true!!
While travelling through Thailand a couple of years ago, I had already decided that I would not see any elephants as I was hyper aware of their unethical treatment that plagues Thailand. HOWEVER, after making anew friends in Pai, they told me about this magical place that has reduced a mother/daughter duo of elephants who happened to be pregnant at the time. Once we arrived, after crossing a very small river and getting a little wet, all of the elephants scratches and feeding awaited us. This was my dream come true! After giving them all the snacks, the owners's partner offers amazing Thai dishes that are beyond memorable! So be ready to eat! This experience was one of the best moments I had while travelling in S.E.A for 6 months.

P.S this place is an eco sanctuary and farm so you get the opportunity to plant a little tree and leave beyond a positive impact while you're one your travels.
