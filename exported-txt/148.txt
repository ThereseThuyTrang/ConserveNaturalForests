This place is awesome, they really care about their elephants and are passionate about the environment! It's so tricky to find a place to visit elephants that is actually ethical and treats their animals right, but conserve natural forests is definitely one of the few! They joke the "owner" of the elephants loves them more than his girlfriend. Such kind staff and you get to plant a tree too!
