Wonderful experience
This is a wonderful project! It is a small but authentic project that really cares about nature and about elephants. They do a wonderful job and make you feel like at home. I spend there one of the best days of my trip. I will defenitly go back If I am in Thailand again. Thanks so much for sharing it with us! I wish you all the best!
