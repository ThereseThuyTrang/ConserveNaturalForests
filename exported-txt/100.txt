Regenerating the forest, one tree at a time
Found this organisation through TripAdvisor, and glad I did. I wanted to interact with Asian elephants in some way while in north Thailand but, having heard so many horror stories about so called sanctuaryâ€™s I was looking for a place without riding or either bathing.

Conserve Natural Forests is focused on regenerating the forest in what was previous agricultural land. By creating a tree species rich environment, the aim is to increase biodiversity of surrounding national park forest. All visitors have the opportunity to plant a tree at the end of the visit to help with this aim.

The organisation also has a breeding programme for endangered tortoises, that have been rescued from being eaten. That will eventually be released to the wild.

The secret to a healthy forest is apparently elephant poo, and this is produced in great quality by Kamee who is also heavily pregnant. Visitors have the opportunity to interact with the elephant and help to feed its daily dose of bananas. It goes without saying that there is no riding or bathing involved

The owner and staff were all super passionate about what they do. Well worth a visit.
