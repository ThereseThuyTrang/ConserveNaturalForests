Amazing work and great way to spend the day outdoors
After checking out my options of spending the day outdoors ( and going to see elephants without supporting the elephant parks / cruel sightseeing )
I spent the day at the Conserve Natural Forest .
The sign up was easy , the pickup was organized and a safe drive down to the forest .
It was great to see a human place and really was a beautiful day !!!!
Highly recommend the place .
