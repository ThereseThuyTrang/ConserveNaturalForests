Most wonderful experience in Thailand
The title says it all. This place is fantastic. Beautiful vision and energy. These people really care about nature. When we visited, they had adopted an elephant who would stay there until she gives birth, after which she will be part of a program of elephant reintroduction. We loved how they let her roam fence free. It was really magical being able to learn more about this project.
