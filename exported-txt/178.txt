Incredible Experience
Dec 2016
It was an absolute privilege to meet Miguel and Hippo, learn about the reforestation project they are working on, and of course, interact with the 2 beautiful Mama's-to-be. We loved it so much we went back for a second visit. If you only do one thing in Pai, make sure it's this!
P.s the passionfruit gin and tonics are out of this world!
