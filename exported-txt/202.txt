Amazing experience...really special!
I am very amazed at the love that comes along with this experience. I went in with zero expectations and left with an experience that i will never forget. Miguel, Hippo, and the whole staff of mahoots do an exception job with the rehabilitation and the development of the elephants. I was very impressed with the whole exprience and would recommend it to anyone staying in Pai for a few days.
