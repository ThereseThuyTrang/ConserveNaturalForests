Fantastic experience and project
Learnt so much about forestry, agriculture and sustainability from great staff who loved answering weird questions and showing me all their hard work! They made the tour feel really informal and natural and it's such a nice place to spend an afternoon. They have a wonderful sassy elephant and turtles (who sometimes hide). A really worthy cause!
