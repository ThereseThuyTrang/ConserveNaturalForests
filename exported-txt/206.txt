Blown away by this place!
A couple of years back I was planting trees here in the north of Thailand with the team from Charn Chai Muay Thai and met the man with a plan Miguel. The aim of his NGO was to Conserve Natural Forests (as the name suggests!) but also to provide a beautiful, free and natural environment for rescued elephants to thrive in. Coming back to Pai and seeing that he's achieved this goal after so much hard work and perseverance, with the help of a small but dedicated team of interns, has been inspiring and a real highlight of my travels. Such an amazing experience I'll never forget. Big love to everyone involved. Looking forward to seeing how things develop with the organic farm, the birds and turtles, and when the little baby elephants arrive...

Good people doing good things :)
