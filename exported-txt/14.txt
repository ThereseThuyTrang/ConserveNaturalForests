Inspiring eco-tour
Dec 2022
Conserve Natural Forests contributes a lot to forest restauration ! Not only in Pai but also in Krabi where they planted lots of terrestrial and mangrove trees, around 35000 trees. The CNF team contributes also to better understanding of the importance of forests.
It is worth visiting them since it exposes to forest issues beyond words and speeches. You can prepare seedlings, and see the nursery site while CNF explains what they do and why. A botanical garden is being prepared mainly focused on endangered species. For those who want to better grasp what is at stake with forests and also offset their carbon footprint, it is worth having their eco-tour. Last but not least, you spend a very nice afternoon in a charming place.
