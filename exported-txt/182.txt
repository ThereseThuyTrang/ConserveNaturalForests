Best place to meet elephants
I stay at the organization as an intern for two month and only after one day I fell in love with this place. The people are so open hearted, the food is delicious and the elephants have a wonderful life here. The tourists can feed them, wash them and just spend some time with them. The rest of the day they can move free on the big and beautiful land. If you are in Pai it is a must-do activity to visit this place for one day.
