Amazing experience learning about reforestation, elephants, bio diversity and trees
Conserve natural forest is a must visit when in the Pai area, not only for the amazing experience but for what you actually learn there. We visited the project site and the team there seem to be doing brilliantly in terms of reforestation, wildlife conservation and education. We learnt about the process of planting a tree from it being a seed through to the germination process to actually planting a tree ourselves. We absolutely felt like we was taking the right steps to offset our carbon footprint.
The project site is in such a beautiful location with a lush river running right through making it a great location for Kamee the Elephant to live a healthy and happy life in an environment that seems to be perfect for elephants. We got to follow Kamee around in her natural habitat which was amazing while sipping on a refreshing passion fruit gin and tonic watching Kamee eat and forage for herself. If you love nature, elephants and learning about how you can make a better impact for the world then your gonna love conserve natural forest.
