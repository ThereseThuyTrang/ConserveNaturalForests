Team members were extremely kind, the mission was great, and the location was beautiful, but kids were bored because there wasn't much to do or see. They call it a donation, but it is not if it is a must. You must pay 1000 baht per person. Families shouldn't spend money on it, and it isn't worth it. If you care about the forest - just donate, you can skip the tour.
