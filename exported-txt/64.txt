Elephant and reforestation project in the breathtaking mountains of Northern Thailand
This was such a beautiful experience. Their main focus is planting trees to save our forests and environment. Jason was incredibly knowledgeable about the project and was able to answer any questions about reforestation and taking care of the pregnant elephant, Cami. The land is breathtaking, we crossed a river to watch the elephant eat tons and tons of trees in her natural habitat. My favorite part was planting a tree. It feels like a family, we were able to relax with some delicious passionfruit mojitos and home-cooked Northern Thai food :) I would definitely go back and recommend it to anyone looking for a genuine experience.
