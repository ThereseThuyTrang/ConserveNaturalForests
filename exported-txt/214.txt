Miguel and his team are a true inspiration
The drive out to Conserve Natural Forest is its a beautiful and wonderful part of the journey, where you get a chance to see the less traveled roads of Pai. They don't pretend to be a great big attraction, they are just doing their best to do what is right for nature and the planet. Whether that be adopting pregnant elephants from abusive owners, restarting an entire plant ecosystem that had been damaged by pesticides from farmlands, building an aviary for native birds, or rescuing tortoises that are endangered from becoming lunch. The warmth that you get from these people is truly genuine. Their cooking and their gin and tonics are delicious as well. It is a great way to spend an afternoon and support some local conservationists who are trying to make a difference.

Unfortunately, my friend and I were injured from a motorcycle accident (Be careful out there) and were unable to get in the water to wash the elephants with everyone else. All the others loved that part.
