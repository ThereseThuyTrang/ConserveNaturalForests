Learn, protect the earth, meet an elephant
This trip I learned so much about the history of elephant exploitation and was honored to support a project that cares so much about nature and the beings that live in it. The elephants was so well taken care of. I came 5 years ago, and again 2 years later and now. I got to see the tree I planted grow up and learn about the impact my little tree and support of this project has on the world. Conserve natural forests makes me believe that we can be helpful, one day at a time. The staff was so friendly and you see the love they have for nature and the elephant they are responsible for now. I wish her a great birth of her baby and I can't wait to visit again next year when the baby has arrived.
