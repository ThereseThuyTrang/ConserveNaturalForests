I visited a few years ago with my friend when we were on holiday in Pai. Being someone who Is very much against animals being used as entertainment or for profit, I was naturally very skeptical about seeing elephants in Thailand. I am 100% opposed to riding elephants and would not have gone to see them and donated if that was the case. The experience I had was something I will never forget. When I was there I met two beautiful and heavily pregnant elephants who were hanging out freely and playing in a little stream out in the forest. We spent house there (there was a very small group of us) feeding the elephants bananas. The two elephants seemed very content and happy and it was clear to me that these animals were living the best life they could and the owners of the conservation park had the purest intentions in doing what is right for them. It was truly a rare opportunity seeing and interacting with these animals ethically. I remember the guy working at the park (which was not gated or fenced of anything) to be knowledgeable, kind and gentle. He taught us how to plant trees and fully explained what he was hoping to achieve with the park. The fee at the time was a donation of our choice. I cant remember what I donated but I wish I could have given more.
