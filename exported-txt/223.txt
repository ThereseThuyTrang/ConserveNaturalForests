My best experience in Thailand
My sister and I really wanted to have an experience with elephants in Thailand. However, we were very afraid of picking an organization that does not treat the animals well. A girl at SpicyPai recommended "Conserve Natural Forests" and we booked a visit for the next day. We got picked up at OmGarden, had a great ride to the place and were crazy happy once we got to see two pregnant elephants. They bought the animals off tourist organizations that maltreated them and it was great to see how happy the elephants were, living free in the protected environment. It was amazing to get to learn about the elephants and how elephants are usually kept in Thailand from people that really care about the animals' welfare. Of course it was also great to learn about the problem of deforestation in Thailand and to actually get to plant trees! We were both just smiling all afternoon. I also enjoyed a freshly cooked Pad Thai while observing the elephants. - Best experience we had in Thailand!
