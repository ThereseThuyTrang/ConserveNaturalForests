"Conscious and Eco friendly tour"
Conserve Natural Forests is such a cool place to hang out for a day tour. Here I got to learn about the nature as a whole being practically involved in a field. It's a rehabilitation center for elephants and endangered tortoises where we can see how the conservation works along with the going projects. Its about 16 km far away to the north from town and very peaceful and amazing. Their main focus is to increase the home for wildlife by afforestation which goes everyday. It was wonderful to get here and tour with them. It worth the time and visit with ambitious nature and the walk with crew members.
