Where elephant is boss
Chilled out place where the elephant is boss and we are her slaves! Peeling and hand feeding her bananas, shooing away the flies. Her carers collect fresh herbs for her health. Nice change from her past life as a slave to humans.
The whole centre here is centred around reaforestation as a means to protect endangered species and the environment as a whole. This year they hope to hit the 1 million tree mark. Great work guys.
Another thing I'd like to add is that the elephants that come here are bought at considerable expense with the end game being they will be released into a safe place where they can be free and wild. Your donations really are for the benefit of the elephants and the environment.
