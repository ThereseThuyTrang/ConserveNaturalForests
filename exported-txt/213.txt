An honest and sincere way to help the natural ecosystem of Thailand!
Conserve Natural Forest's was by far one of the highlights of my trip to Thailand. It was a breath of fresh air finding an organization that was making an honest and upfront attempt at helping the natural ecosystem in Thailand in various ways, from saving endangered species of animals to recreating the natural forests. Not only did I learn a lot from the small team of organizers who are making this miracle happen, but I also got the chance to do some real contributing. You get to interact with elephants in a humane and intimate way by helping wash them and feeding them, and also got to plant some native trees in the area. I hope to make it back one day to help contribute more to this incredible cause.
