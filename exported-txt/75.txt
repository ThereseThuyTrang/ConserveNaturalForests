Unforgettable Experience
I highly recommend visiting CNF to anyone staying in Pai! Unlike most elephant “sanctuaries”, CNF is an elephant rehabilitation area that purchases abused and working elephants and reintroduces them into the jungle (national parks). Miguel and his team are also planting thousands of trees and helping other indigenous jungle animals! Miguel’s passion for the project is infectious.

A visit to CNF is incredibly educational and an amazing experience to see a wild elephant doing its own thing. You can feed Kami bananas and watch her, but she is by no means exploited like other elephant centers. CNF can pick you up and in Pai and drive you to their land, or you can get there by motorbike.

I highly recommend cruising there on a motorbike, it’s an easy beautiful ride through the countryside. Just don’t drink too many of Miguel’s famous passion fruit gin and tonics 😉 If you get there early enough, there are some natural super hot hot springs about 30 min further down the road worth visiting also.

We visited CNF three times during our Pai stay to spend time with Mama Kami and to talk with Miguel. I can’t recommend this place enough, it’s definitely a must see when in the Pai area. Thanks for everything Miguel and CNF family.
