Thank you Conserve Natural Forests for your wonderful actions on saving this planet climate. I am thankful for the remarkable experience in visiting the planted areas and taking part in a plating event this year. The planting technique is really great and should be adopted to all forests. I also like the idea to use elephant's poop, that's terrific. So excited to see how the forest will look like in the next few years.
