Best elephant experience in Pai
Mar 2017
Want to meet Elephants that have not been subjected to cruelty and abuse? Welcome to Conserve Natural Forests. Awesome experience and really great staff! Grab yourself a Passion-fruit G'n'T and lay in the river next to the Elephants whilst they bathe and feed on Pumpkin and Bananas. Worth every cent of the 500Baht i donated to this great cause!
