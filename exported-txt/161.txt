Best experience of my life!!
Had the most magical day here. What this organization does brought me to tears. Not only did we spend the afternoon with two beautiful pregnant female elephants but we got to be a part of something huge and plant our own tree - I named mine Fred☺️. Being with these elephants free of chains and in the free splashing with them as they got bathed by the Thai people who help this organization was magical. I found myself pinching myself to see if it was a dream. I caught myself with tears in my eyes more times than I can count. My favorite part about it was they don't call themselves a sanctuary. They are rehabilitating what we as people have been destroying for years. Please if you have time research this amazing organization and begin to follow them and there journey. If you are in Pai and or plan to come please please put this in your top things to do! Xxx
