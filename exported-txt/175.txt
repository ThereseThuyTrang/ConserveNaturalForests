Best experience ever !!
A great place with a great mission. They are a non profit organization surviving from donations, some government support and a lot of love and investment from the owner-Miguel. Their main aim is reforestation of areas in need in developping countries and saving endangered animals. The elephants there (two pregnant females- one due anyday now) are free to do what ever they want, they are not chained or hurt in any way. They were brought there from a camp where they were used for taking tourists on their backs all day every day for years...A very very warm recommendation, best experience in Pai area.
