Amazing experience. Great cause.
My partner and I loved visiting the conservation area and learning about the great work done to replenish deforestation and nurse elephants back to health.

We spent the afternoon feeding a beautiful elephant and learning about the project from the founder and his wife. Later we planted a tree; a reminder that tourism should not always be take take take.

I would highly recommend visiting and spending an afternoon here. At the very least, your money goes directly to conservation efforts and incredible work being done by such a small team.

Try one of Miguel's famous gin and tonics if you get the chance!
