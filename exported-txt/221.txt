Lovely place and great experience
We went to Conserve Natural Forests together with a big group and ended up staying the whole day listening to the important work that these guys do.

It was simply amazing to sit and eat in the water while the pregnant elephants were chilling just a couple of meters away.

Best way to spend a day in the north of Thailand
