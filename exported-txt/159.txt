Want to be with elephants? This is the best way to do it!
This was one of the best things I've experienced in my life! I'm an animal rights activist and hate the exploitation of any animals. I really wanted to visit elephants in nature, in a nice way.. was lucky to found this place through tripadvisor.
This NGO is an example against animal exploitation and offers this two elephants an amazing rehabilitation and big living space to enjoy their pregnancy, saved from the cruel riding business. Everything was so nice and peaceful, from picking up, visiting, feeding, walking and bathing them, you can see and feel clearly that they are happy and that this people are treating them well! We also planted some seeds and trees, had a delicious thai food.. I would spend some more days there or at least one night, if it was possible.
Will recommend this place to anyone going to Thailand and hopefully one day all the elephant sanctuaries will be like this one!
