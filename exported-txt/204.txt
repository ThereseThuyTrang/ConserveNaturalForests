Conscious, sustainable, and really fun people!
We happened upon this place when talking to a friend who's been in Pai for many years. No riding, no "working" elephants here... just a growing land base being reforested, and a bunch of wonderful, hard-working, and fun people taking really good care of these animals. Hearing the story of how unique this project is, and where it's headed was so inspiring. We were also blessed to be able to help plant many trees on the property as well. This was one of our favorite days in the valley because of the people we met!
