Happy Heffalumps!
I admit that I have been one of those tourists who visited a commercial elephant camp and only then realised how wrong it was to ride the elephants and see them forced into a bathing pool so that tourists could splash them with water whilst they looked miserable and broken. I swore I would never do anything like this again and would encourage others not to.

I then started hearing so many good things about this project just outside of Pai called Conserve Natural Forest where they have two elephants roaming free on the land of their conservation project. It took me some time to visit but when I did I was delighted to see just how happy these big, beautiful ladies were! Both mother and daughter where both rescued from tourit camps and heavily pregnant… a marvel to see!

There is such a nice vibe at the centre between the project leaders, volunteers, mahouts and the Thai staff and you can see they all love the elephants like family…. you can even see that the elephants are very aware of this and grateful for their new life.

It’s a beautiful way to spend an afternoon, hanging out with these majestic beasts, learning about conservation and leaving a good mark by planting some trees. Another plus is that the ride out there is wonderful with stunning views of the surrounding area of Pai. You can either jump in the pick-up truck or ride out behind the group on your own bike.

Conserve Natural Forests simply ask for a donation which goes directly back into funding this incredible project. And you must try the Gin and Tonics and delicious food from Hippo’s Kitchen!

Highly recommended as one of the things you must do when visiting Pai!
