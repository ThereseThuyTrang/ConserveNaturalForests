Fantastic day
We went to conserve natural forest yesterday and had a really great day there. It started when we drove on the back of a pick-up to go to the conserve. We were a group of about 10 people, so that we got in contact with the guides really fast. They explained us what their organization stands for before we met the elephant ladie. She was allowed to walk freely and seemed to be happy as well.
