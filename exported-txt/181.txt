Simply incredible
it was one of the greatest expieriences i ever had. Miguel (the owner) and his Team really give you the Feeling of how important it is to conserve the Nature and protect the elephants. it is a real authentic sanctuary, where we never felt a single second they just do it for tourists. its also a lot cheaper than Other Programs (we paid 500 baht each). and they Are taking the money directly to Support their Programm. I can highly recommend going there. when you Visit there, also ask miguel for a gin tonic ðŸ˜‚
