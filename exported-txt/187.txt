Elephantastic Earth Enhancing Experience!!
For a great start to the day I would recommend that you arrive at the meeting point, an hour or so early so that you can venture to Cafecito and enjoy one of the most popular brunches you will find in Pai. After which, you will enjoy one of the most spectacular drives of your life, that is the road to this haven.

You might have encountered Elephants before but, even still, prepare to be in awe. There are no words I can find to give justice to what I felt. It’s natural to feel initially overwhelmed by the Elephants but they have a charm and gentleness that will relax you. Before you know it, you will be closer than you can ever have imagined.

Both rescued Elephants are pregnant. The daughter is due any day, so not only can you see the baby calf silhouette around her body, you can also see it move and even feel it....it’s unbelievable!!

The founders are a delightful couple with a team of passionate workers who are more like a family. Everyone is extremely friendly and hospitable. Hippo makes the most fantastic Thai food and, if you would like a beverage, then just sit back and enjoy a gin and tonic with Miguel.

Moreover, the experience is very educational for those who are interested in conservation and those with children. You will learn not only about the Elephant rescue program but also about the primary goal of reforestation.

The day ends with the group joining together to plant trees that have been carefully selected by professional eco-graduates to best suit and thrive in a natural habitat. This is a wonderful opportunity to give something back and leave with the most heartwarming feeling from a day very well spent!! I can't wait to go back again & again!!!
