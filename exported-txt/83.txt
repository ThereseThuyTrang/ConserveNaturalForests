Great organisation for a good cause
I loved the aim of Conserve Natural Forests! They really care about the nature, the environment, and the eco system. An elephant was sooo cute as well and I enjoyed listening to the background story. The thing is that there are too much chill time that I felt awkward at one point staying with people being silent watching other people feeding the elephant. I just thought it would be more great if there is more learning activity or experience. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.
