happy elephant - happy people
My first impression - I was amazed. At CNF I could learn about reforestation, wildlife rehabilitation and conservation.

First, they will show and explain you their running project of the endangered tortoises. After that a detailed explanation about the endangered species of asian elephants will follow and make you aware of the problematics, which most of us didnâ€™t know. Currently they have one elephant named Kamee and its beautiful how they treat her. Kamee is free to do whatever she likes so she is not forced to do anything. This is a great way to show her the natural life of an elephant before releasing her into the national park!! It's not like other places where elephants are forced to entertain tourists. No riding, no forced bathing, no abusing, no chains. We just joined her with whatever she was feeling like doing. She looks really happy and healthy for sure!

Another big project they are working on is the reforestation. Their goal is to plant at least 1 Million trees a year! I also got to experience the project in first hand by planting a tree on my own. Since the tour is about 4 hours long, I had a lot of time asking the staff about their projects and about anything that crossed my mind. They are very kind and heartwarming people! And once you participate in a tour and donate, you can come back any time for free.

I would recommend this place for people who want to experience and learn about nature the right way. :)
