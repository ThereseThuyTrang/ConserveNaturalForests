Great time at CNF!
CNF does a really great job on their project site in Pai, Thailand. The drive in is absolutely scenic as you wind through jungle foliage, pass rice paddies and garlic farms, and make your way toward the Pai River where this organization owns a beautiful plot of land. After arriving, me and the other guests I was with settled in while one of the interns went through a nice introduction of what CNF does; what they're all about. We learned about the reforestation efforts and some of the history of this NGO. The site boasts 30 species of plants in their demonstration forest and walking through it was really an experience in and of itself. You don't really know what to expect until you're right in the middle of the thing.

Besides reforestation, this NGO has also acquired a female elephant, Cami, who we spent plenty of time with and fed bananas to. To see this elephant in a totally free setting where she could graze all day and make her own tracks through the land was really special. It's simply great to visit an organization that cares so much for this endangered animal, for the future of their species, and of course for a more sustainable future.

After feeding Cami a number of bananas and spending time with her, we went back under the shade and enjoyed a passionfruit gin and tonic and some Pad Thai made by some amazing cooks, and then chilled out for awhile and lost track of time. Eventually a CNF intern took us back into the demonstration forest, where we concluded the day with a tree planting session. It was very fitting to say the least.
