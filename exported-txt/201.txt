Best part of Pai. Amazing place and amazing people
I was in Pai earlier this year, after visiting CNF I ended up coming back almost everyday. What has been created here is inspirational, to see the elephants in their natural habit was unforgettable. Miguel and Hippo are two of the loveliest people I've ever met and wish them all the best with this amazing project.
