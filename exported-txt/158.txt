Wonderful
After the bikeride we arrived at the Park. First we got more information about the park and afterwards you will cross the river and take a look at the two pregnant elephants! So cool, those animals are so impressive. You'll have a lot of time to feed them and you can help with washing the elephants (that is necessary! They've never learned how to wash themselves) and feed them even more. I really got the impression the elephants are here at the right spot. If I had more time, I would go voluntary.
