Proper elephant conservation
I had a friend who volunteered here a few years ago and invited me to come and visit. It was an amazing experience and the elephants were pregnant at the time. This is truly a conservation that cares about the elephants unlike many other organisations in Thailand where the elephants are a tourist attraction. Would highly recommend a visit to anyone who's in the Pai area. 11/10
