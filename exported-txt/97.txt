Amazing Project, Must Do in Pai
I went to Conserve Natural Forests a few times when I was in Pai two years ago, and couldn’t wait to take my mom when she was visiting. This is a very unique organization that is working to combat deforestation, one of the root issues for elephants & other wildlife in Thailand. It is very educational. You learn about deforestation, the history of working elephants in Thailand, & you get to see tortoises, an elephant, & plant a tree. Miguel, the owner/founder, his wife Hippo who makes great Thai food, and our tour guide Jason were all awesome. When we went they had one very pregnant elephant (due any time!), Kamee. Kamee is being rehabilitated so that she & her baby can eventually be released into a protected forest. There are no hooks, chains, bathing, or forcing her to do anything or go anywhere. Tours are small groups and they only have one a day so that she has minimal interactions with people throughout the day. You get to hang out with Kamee, feed her some snacks, & observe her do & go where she pleases while her mahouts & the staff are ensuring the safety & well being of Kamee and visitors. When we were there in December there was a family with young children, and our guide clearly explained potential hazards & guidelines and made sure the parents & kids understood before starting the tour. When one of the children started approaching the elephant from behind, Hippo noticed right away and immediately brought it to attention to ensure the child’s safety. If you want to interact with elephants ethically, this is the only place to do it in my opinion. Even though other places advertise no riding, no hooks, etc, those elephants are still working all day every day & typically not treated well.
