Amazing organisation!
We heard about this place through a friend who visited last year so decided to look it up during our visit to Pai. The work they do here is fantastic!! The main focus is reforestation and supporting the eco system - each vistor will plant 1 tree at the end of the tour. We learnt so much during our time there about reducing carbon footprint, how many trees we need to cancel out or own emissions from our trip etc. The highlight of our trip was spending time with Kamee the elephant and seeing how well treated she is! The organisation work alongside other charities to rehabilitate their animals into the wild. (They also had some land tortoises which are going to be released shortly). We crossed the river and trekked through the forest to find Kamee - she is living as free as their land allows. She came across the river with us where we were able to feed her bananas and pumpkins. During this time she was still free to wander around us as we sat talking about elephant care and the work the organisation does - she is not caged, chained or locked up at any point and is cared for in the best way. She is currently 24 months pregnant and in a few years her and her baby are set to be rehabilitated into the wild. Wes was a fantastic tour leader and he was really informative!! The place also offers fresh cooked food and passionfruit gin and tonic - all just 50 baht each. All visitors pay 1000 baht but can return at any point and not pay the fee again! I cannot recommend this place enough.
