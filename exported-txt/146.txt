truly is a wonderful experience
I emphasize "experience" because a visit to conserve natural forest is much more than a day spent with 2 wonderful elephants. It is a day spent with friends and people who truly care about the conservation of the environment. The elephants are Amazing, they are gentle giants, who are very easy to interact with. The secret to their hearts are lots of pumpkins. They will literally eat them all day. The people who work there are super nice and very passionate about what they do. Once you get tired of playing with the elephants you can enjoy fresh delicious Thai food as well as cold beverages. Stop by for a visit. It is truly a once in a lifetime experience.
