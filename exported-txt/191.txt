DON'T LEAVE THAILAND WITHOUT VISITING HERE
What Miguel and his team are doing at Conserve Natural Forests is exactly what not only Thailand but what South East Asia needs. The education above all they are providing for the local farmers will go a long, long way for future generations. As well as educating locals and tourist about the horrors elephants in the tourist industry go through. This is a day that will live in your heart for the rest of your life, and you feel instantly attached to the amazing elephants and feel immensely proud that you have help in some way towards the future of Thailand by helping replant the forest. I can not speak highly enough about Miguel and his team. If you leave Thailand without visiting Miguel and his elephants then you are making a huge mistake.
