Incredible
I went with my boyfriend and we had the most incredible and educational experience. The guides and staff are kind, fun and knowledgeable (shout out to Jason). This is truly a sanctuary and they do incredible work to support and care for the elephants.

I cannot recommend this place enough to anyone wanting to see elephants and learn more about their place in Thailandâ€™s wildlife.
