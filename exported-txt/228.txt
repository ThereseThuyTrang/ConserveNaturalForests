I got to know about Conserve Natural Forests through a fellow traveler-friend. It is honestly an amazing place with passionate individuals genuinely caring for the elephants and environment. If you have always wanted to spend some time with some elephants at a sustainable organisation, i highly recommend this place rather than the extremely commercialized ones in Chiang Mai, and I'm sure you'll have as much fun as I did. :)
