Great experience
Fantastic experience, really loved learning about the environment in Thailand and the important work they are doing here. Met the lovely elephant, who is treated very well and is free to roam without bother from visitors, itâ€™s great to just observe her eating bananas and living a free life. Would definitely recommend visiting.
