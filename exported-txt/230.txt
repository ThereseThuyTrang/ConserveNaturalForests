If you want to see elephants, come here.
My friends and I were looking for a place to see elephants where they don't ride or mistreat them. Luckily we found this place, which is involved in much more than elephants.

We rode with our motorbikes from Pai following their truck. Once on site we were greeted by everyone, including the two pregnant elephants (due very soon, when rainy season is over) and they explained their whole project which we were all so happy to support. Afterwards, we fed them endless amounts of corn and bananas and went into the river to bathe them. We had the opportunity to spend time and know all about them. At the end, after having lunch, we each planted two trees.

We had the greatest time and everyone was so nice! I would definitely recommend coming here.
