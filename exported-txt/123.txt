Incredible. A must do.
If you’re looking for an incredible, personal experience to have with an elephant and get an understanding of ecotourism, look no further. If you’re looking to get a selfie with an elephant doing tricks for you, then look somewhere else.

At Conserve Natural Forest, you’ll spend the afternoon seeing a majestic animal in her natural habitat, feed her until she’s done eating (not when you’re done giving her a handful of bananas), hang out with her and learn about elephants while practicing eco tourism by planting trees.

Words do not describe how incredible and pure the experience was. There is a 1,000bat donation, but after learning that all the money goes into buying the food and paying for the 24/7 supervision so the elephant isn’t fenced or caged, we have more.

If you’re still reading this review by now, just go. You won’t regret it.
