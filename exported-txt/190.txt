The most amazing thing we've done in Thailand
I cannot explain how amazing of a day that we had here. These elephants are so well taken care of and happy and you can tell just by their behavior. Miguel and crew are doing amazing work here with not just the elephants but with reforestation. I'm so happy that we went and got to be apart of this.
