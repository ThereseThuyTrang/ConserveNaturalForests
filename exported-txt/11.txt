Phenomenal People, Excellent Ethical Experience
On thehalf-day tour our guide Thierry was wonderfully knowledgeable and charismatic. He and the rest of the team, especially Martin, were wonderful with answering all of our questions and succinctly explaining the aims, methods, and outcomes of the project.

We helped to seed 10 papaya trees each, and were fortunate to see the elephant Kami, who lives on their land. We weren't allowed to approach, touch or feed her, which is good. She isn't a pet, and it was a privelage to see her from a distance.

Lastly, we left our bag on the transport back by accident. The staff were truly wonderful and dropped it back to us in Pai in 10 minutes as soon as we contacted them. Genuinely couldn't ask for more kind or attentive people.
