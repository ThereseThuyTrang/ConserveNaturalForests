Really interesting project!
Aug 2019
Great alternative to other animal "sanctuaries"! Their wonderful elephant-lady walks around freely on their wonderful property. She will happily come by to get a snack from visitors and eat until she chooses to leave by her free will. If you're an elephant fan and want to support a project, that keeps their's truly free, this foundation is highly recommended. I fell in love with her immediately.
The other part of the project is reforestation. It is also explained by the friendly and funny staff. Visitors are asked to plant 10 seeds and a seedling in the soil in order to become part of the project :) This only takes 5 minutes and it's really fun! Understand that you are not paying a PRICE for a tour, you are giving a DONATION to a project which is truly worthy of your support!
