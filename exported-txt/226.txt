Amazing conservation in Pai
Thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Conserve Natural Forests - They have a great set up and are dedicated to the environment by restoring and maintaining not only their land but other places throughout the neighbouring towns which is refreshing to see.
There are a number of elephant conservations in Pai and Chiang Mai which I have never personally visited but have heard many things about, generally they are very touristic and overpriced starting at 2,500 baht for one day.
What i loved about this organisation was that it was donation based, minimum of 500 baht but feel free to donate as much as you like but the groups are small and its a very personal experience, they don't rush you and give you plenty of time with the elephants to feed and bathe them.
Also you are able to give back to the environment by helping plant trees or pack seeds for their future reforestation projects.

At present they have two female elephants (mother and daughter) who are both pregnant, one being due any day now so if you visit you'll most likely get to see the baby :)

Visitors are welcome every day and they pick/drop you off in the centre of town. time is 1-5pm and you need to book through the website or on their Facebook page!

If you are looking for a unique and genuine experience visit here and help them raise enough money to continue their amazing work!!
