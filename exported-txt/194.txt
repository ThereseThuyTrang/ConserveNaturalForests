A better way to meet and interact with elephants.
A great elephant conservation project that focuses on the purpose of creating change by introducing an alternative that is natural and more sustainable. Conserve Natural Forest provides a better way to meet and interact with elephants. Your support raises awareness of the dangers elephants are exposed to when used for profit in the tourist and entertainment industry such as trekking and shows which often result in mistreatment and a harsh environment of living for the elephants. I highly recommend paying a visit, a moving experience that is great for the elephants and also your conscious.
