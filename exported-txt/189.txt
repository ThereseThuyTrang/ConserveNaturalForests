Amazing project!
It was an amazing day at Conserve Natural Forest! The idea of the project is just great. It was fun to hang out with the two beautiful elephants, who are both expecting babies soon (sadly not yet ;)). It would have just been great if someone came with us right from the beginning to tell us more about the elephants. But in the end there was enough time to ask all our questions! Highly recommended place! Don't go to an elephant camp and ride on one. Go to conserve natural forest:)
