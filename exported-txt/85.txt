Great work and people
I came to Southeast Asia with a plan to visit an elephant sanctuary once along my travels. With each potential stop I’d look up the companies and find questionable reviews and opinions likening these sanctuaries to circuses so I decided it would be something I missed until I could see them in the wild one day. Then I found a recommendation for Conserve Natural Forests and only positive reviews. That’s because this isn’t a circus show but rehabilitation for the single elephant they can currently manage that they will release back into the wild once her baby is strong enough to make the journey. This isn’t even the prime goal of the group, their primary objective is reforesting parts of Thailand with elephants being a integral part in that process (poop full of nutrients). The guides were kind and informative, and I really enjoyed my time with them and some like minded individuals during my visit and hope everyone considers this group if they want to see an elephant on their trip and support a worthy cause.
