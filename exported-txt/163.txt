a good surprise!
I came to thailand to train muay thai, not really for turism, and normaly i get away from any crowded turist atraction. Then I heard about this place, where they have 2 elephants rescued from some nasty turistic busines at chiang mai, and they rase money for a huge reflorestation project. I went to check, not really convinced, and I really don't regreat it!
The two elephant ladies, both of then pregnants, spend the day eating pumpkins, and walking freely around in this big land. Nothing to do with the chained elephant riding torture. Even if there are loats of visitors, if the elephants decide to cross de river to have some fresh grass in the other side, no body force then to be there to please the public. Fantastic experience to be in the river with those huge animals, feed then with loats of pumpkins, seen then wondering around freely.
It's not all! I ate one of my best thai noodles since i'm in thailand! Hippo, this charming thai ladie, cooks all in fire wood, and she has some devine gift to prepare the best curry ever!
Then I try the gorgeus gin-tonic-passion fruit prepared by Miguel, with my feet on the river, chiling out, digesting the unforguetable curry...
I really recomend this place, and I wish good luck to Miguel, Hippo and their crew on this incredible project
