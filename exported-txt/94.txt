Beautiful and very informative
A nice experience where you can learn about reforestation and the true facts about the elephants in Thailand. Perfect choice if you've been wanting to get out in nature while gaining knowledge about the surroundings. There is a shuttle that will pick you up close to Pai center which makes it very convenient. Worth the $1000 baht donation.
