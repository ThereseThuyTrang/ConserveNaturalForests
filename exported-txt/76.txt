A one of a kind experience
Conserve Natural Forest is a one of a kind experience. This is one of those rare experience, that is more education than tourism. You get the unique opportunity to see an elephant living undisturbed in it's natural environment. You also get to learn about the indigenous trees, and animals in this area. Shoshoni, Miguel and team were great, full of knowledge and information. I genuinely learned a few things while visiting.

The best part of course is getting to see the beautiful elephants living a free and natural life. You can rest at ease when you visit here because you know the animals are being treated ethically. I was so happy to be a part of it, even if it was just for one day.
