Fantastic experience!
I visited this amazing organisation and was so impressed with their setup and mission that I decided to stay for one month and volunteer for them.

Miguel and Anchala are excellent and welcoming hosts, and the rest of the site staff are diligent and friendly. Overall they have created an amazing atmosphere and make you feel right at home immediately.

The forest itself is beautiful and the history is very interesting. I learnt about the issues of deforestation in Thailand and the government/NGO initiatives to reverse this trend. CNF have re-introduced a wide variety of tree species to restore a thriving eco-system to land that was being abused by farmers

Kamee the elephant is definitely the highlight for me! So nice to see her in her natural environment, roaming free and not being used as a slave for tourism like in other elephant shelters. She comes and goes as she pleases, and turns up for her afternoon snack at the end of the tour.

I would highly recommend visiting this fantastic experience!
