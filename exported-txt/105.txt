Genuine Eco tourism - the real deal!
It was very joyful and relieving to see their work here. As Thailand have many so called "sanctuary centers" most of the are scams where elephants are rented and presented as rescued. This place was different. The elephant was rehabilitated to be released back into the wild. In other words were there no promises of tricks mudbaths, or other displays from the elephant. It stayed around as long as it felt like it (obviously it stayed as we gave it food) and hugging, kissing the elephant was discouraged. In other words, it was treated as an wild animal, with respect and sensibility. The care of the elephant was spotless!
Their main focus is reforestation (regrowing harvested forest) and they are quite good at it! They've even managed to bring back animal species that the locals thought were gone. We had the honor of being part of this process by planting a tree of our own (for free). The owner also made really good tropical gin & tonics that everyone enjoyed!
All in all I'd say that when it comes to genuine eco-tourism this is the real deal.
