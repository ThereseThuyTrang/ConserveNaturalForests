Amazing experience!
I stayed there for 1 month and it was incredible! I was a guide there for the tour during this month and I can guarantee you that it is a must to visit in Pai! All the projects they have carried out on the site are as interesting to see as they are to learn. It was a pleasure to have been able to contribute to this beautiful and great project!
