Top Thailand Experience
This is one of the best travel experiences in Thailand. I visited here with my daughter Olive Louise whilst hanging out in Pai with her. The work Miguel and the team are doing here is absolutely amazing. A very educational experience, I didnâ€™t know that much about the history of elephants in Thailand and the problems with deforestation but learned heaps on this tour. Our guide Jason was just fantastic- very knowledgeable and passionate. The tour was intimate and sensitive, also so wonderful to see how Conserve Natural Forests are working hard to nurture their elephant Kamee to go back into the forest after her baby is born. Returning elephants back to the forest is absolutely necessary to ensure the forests can recover from the damage caused by extensive logging for teak. I do hope that Kamee gives birth without problems and returns to an elephant tribe when she returns one day. Great work!!!
