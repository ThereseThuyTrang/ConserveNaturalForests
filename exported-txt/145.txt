A.ma.zing!!

Two beautiful heavily pregnant elephants have captured my heart. This was the first time visiting a sanctuary and it has set my expectations very high. The group was small, so there was plenty of hands on moments to create ever lasting memories, while being up and close.

It's very clear that these ladies are treated very well and are in great health.

The project is also promoting reforestation and encourages you to plant a few trees so they can reach their goal of 250,000 plants.

The staff were friendly and knowledgeable.

Don't forget the insect repellent! Especially after bathing eles in the river.
