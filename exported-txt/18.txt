Great experience in Pai Ã¡rea!
An amazing afternoon! I am pasionate about nature conservation and meeting a Group of forestry experts full on planting as it is monsoon now, so planting season, was incredible I never imagined i would witness 5,000 trees planted in one Day
The eco tour is also a special experience learning a lot about the forests of northern thailand If You care about nature, CNF is a very reccomended experience
