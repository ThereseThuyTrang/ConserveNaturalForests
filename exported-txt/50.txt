Amazing Experience!
This is such an amazing experience. We got to plant seeds and see the forest that has been regrown by the owners and all of the visitors. They know a lot about conservation and taught us about offsetting our carbon. Of course, feeding bananas to Kamee the elephant was the highlight of the day!
