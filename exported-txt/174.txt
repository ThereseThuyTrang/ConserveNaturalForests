Amazing place!
Me and a few of my friends visited here as this was the best place we could find that was the most caring for the elephants, the staff there were great they spoke to us and taught us a little bit about the 2 elephants there before we went to see them. We had the best day, cheap food and bar there too! Would recommend to anyone & would go again!
