So good I went twice in 3 days!!
I visited CNF twice in January 2019 and had a great time learning all about the history of the elephant industry in Thailand, the impacts of deforestation (we also each planted a tree!) and the story of their 26-month pregnant elephant, Kamee, as we fed her bunches of bananas and other fruit.

Our guide, Jason, was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive to our interests and needs. The tour (and organisation) felt very genuine and I would recommend this to anyone seeking an authentic, up close and personal experience with an elephant.

Thanks to Jason, Miguel, Hippo, and team - you're all doing amazing things for the elephants and the environment. I'll be back to see you again for sure!

P.S - those passionfruit gin and tonics are to die for!!
