Great project and visit
Had the luck of being the only one who booked that day so i could feed the elephant for a very long time which is awesome. Dont expect a set agenda, the elephant has its own agenda and you live by it... which is how its supposed to be. Miguel and his ,sometimes, girlfriend are great people and easy to talk to.

Fully recommend!
