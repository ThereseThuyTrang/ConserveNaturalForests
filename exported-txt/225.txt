Incredible experience, enjoying elephants in their environment
Some backpackers told us to avoid the advertised elephants tours, because they do not respect elephants which are exploited and forced to work. This place is amazing, you simply have to give a free offer (minimum of 500 bahts) which is definitely worth the experience and goes into the support of the project. Best way to save money, support a great environmental project and enjoy elephants in their environment.
