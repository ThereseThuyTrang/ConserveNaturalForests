Favorite Place in Pai
Conserve Natural Forests is by far one of my favorite places in Pai. The tours are so much fun! We learn all about reforestation and rehabilitation for tortoises as well as their elephant Kommee! Itâ€™s a great day of hanging out by the river and planting trees! CNF is my safe haven!
