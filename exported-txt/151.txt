Great organization with an awesome cause! Definitely visit!
My friends and i were looking for an ethical elephant sanctuary to visit while in chiang mai. Since elephant nature park was fully booked, we decided to visit this establishment instead, and boy was it totally worth it. We got to feed and bathe two pregnant elephants in a small group of 12/15 people. Everyone was very respectful of the elephants and you could definitely see the respect the mahouts showed the elephants because they were not forced to do anything they didnt want to do. No riding elephants, no pulling on their ears, no yelling at them.
It was also eye-opening to hear that the sanctuary was initially started as a forest restoration project, which they continue to work on. Each one of the visitors gets to plant a tree to aid in the project. The staff (Miguel, Hippo, Zac, Do, and others) were very entertaining and informative, and I commend them for their commitment to a nobel cause. Definitely try Hippo's cooking (it was delicious) and Miguel's gin and tonics! The trek out to Conserve Natural Forests is worth it if you're in Chiang Mai! I hope to visit again in a few years to see how much my tree has grown and to see the baby elephants!
