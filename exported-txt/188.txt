Amazing day to remember...
Even though we were late and missed the meeting point it was the best day by now. The area is beautiful and the elephants have a lot of space. It was so much fun but also scary to be with those two beautiful elephants. The people who do all this are amazing and really nice but the most important thing is the elephants can walk around without chained on or in a cage and they can eat all day because there are so many trees with fruits and leaves. It is also quite an adventure to get to the place and back since they only have a pickup truck and only four people can sit in front and the others need to sit in the back and this can be funny if you have 13 people to fit in....
Long text, short meaning: Go and enjoy an amazing day there!!!
