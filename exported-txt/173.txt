Slight letdown but worth it.
Jan 2017
The owner clearly deeply cares about not only the elephants but nature in general. But the trip could be organized much better. They sent all 20-25 of us to the elephants at the exact same time. This caused a lot of awkwardness and even anger as people fought for position for photos. Things got a little tense. They simply could bring smaller groups of 5-6 at a time across the river.
They do have pretty good food and drinks to enjoy as the elephants come to the river.
It just all felt like a bit of a money grab (I know they need it and believe it's going to a good cause). But we had that tourist conveyer belt feeling.
It also lasts too long. We were all more than ready to leave. And buy leave I mean in the back of a truck flying down the mountain side. I didn't mind this kind of transportation, but it's something some people should be aware of.
It's worth the 500 baht, but if you can drive or Motorbike yourself that would be best as you can leave when you like.
