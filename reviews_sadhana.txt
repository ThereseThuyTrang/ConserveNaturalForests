Minimalistic, Sustainable, Community living..One of its kind experience..
Dec 2023 • Solo
One should go and see this place to know it better. Some 10 odd kms from Auroville main gate, you can go and visit this place for free. A guide will accompany you and show you around for free. How they stay, cook, work and do other chores. If you want to stay you can book in advance by paying Rs. 600/day (One has to compulsorily help them in their daily routine activities and work)

NOTE-
1) Thursday- Free lunch
2) Stay- for minimum 8 days application accepted (as far as I remember)

Good!
Mar 2024 • Solo
The guide was really good in explaining the works they do and tons of tips and ways shared to better the environment. It's lovely to walk around and look at the plants and trees that were planted many years ago.

The guided tour was worth it and it was lovely that we were given a scrumptious vegetarian meal. The only down side I think is the show that they showed, it was some national geographic or BBC film. I think it would be better to show more slides/films about the forest instead of generic show.

Most amazing community ever!
Apr 2024 • Solo
This is the most amazing community you'll ever find! It has such a powerful, broad and holistic vision, radically choosing a way of living together based on community, unity and social justice. Deeply rooted.in nature, in face showing us we are art of nature. The sustainable community living in the forest is a dream. Everybody should come and visit at least once in their life, and if you really want to experience in depth spend a few weeks here.

New experiences all around
Mar 2024 • Couples
While I came to Sadhana Forest to volunteer in reforestation, I learned and experienced so much more. You can expect to learn information across a wide variety of topics, including zero-waste, composting, water conservation, and vegan cooking. The different types of volunteering range from low to high physical work, but all of it was a welcome change from desk work. With the volunteering I had the opportunity to develop new skills and knowledge, such as different methods of planting new trees or how to make coconut milk from scratch. I loved being part of the Sadhana Forest community and spending quality time with the people here. Everyone is ready to listen and lend a helping hand. If you’re looking for a well-rounded experience that includes volunteering, skill-building, sustainability and community look no further and stay at Sadhana Forest!

Meaningful work at Sadhana Forest
Mar 2024 • Couples
One of the things I like most about Sadhana is that it’s not only the forest that is growing, it’s also the people. You learn so much here, and you can really bring your full self to the community. No one judges you and everyone is so welcoming. The work itself is so meaningful - helping to regrow the natural forest here, cooking for the community, cleaning, preparing water irrigation devices. In that way, you also learn a lot about conservation, sustainability and plant-based diets. These are all things you can bring back and integrate into your life at home. If you’re already thinking about coming here, think no further - do it!!

The place really helped me connect back to myself and people around again.
Mar 2024 • Solo
It is the perfect vacation and volunteering project for me. I get to put my believes in action again and reconnect to parts of myself I hadn’t accessed in a long time. The community is really a safe space and really takes all the social anxiety off you. Also constantly living in the forest helps regulate the nervous system well with all the forest bathing that happens. Doing hands on physical work also helped me learn and start taking care of my body again. And considering the resource footprint minimisation while staying here is an added advantage. And you do all this while helping sustain an evergreen dry forest which has been grown in a dry arid land supporting the local biodiversity and recharging ground water table. I wouldn’t ask for more from a place.

Living with Nature at Sadhana Forest
Mar 2024 • Solo
Sadhana Forest is not just an experience, it's a way of life. I have grown up in India, so community living has always been a part of my childhood, but I never imagined living so closely with nature. Apart from indulging in seva, I learnt a lot of things about myself and it has given my life a direction, an alternative perspective. I realised that all the other species apart from humans have different personalities, moods, tantrums, emotions, experience pain, and trauma, just like humans and acknowledging all of this is very important. I also learnt to use compost toilets and to manage the compost after, which was one of my nightmares. But after I did it, I realised it's not at all how i imagined it to be. I relished some very delicious cuisine from all over the world each day I spent here. I worked and met with different people from around the world and learnt about different cultures. I have made friends for life in a very short span of time. In the process, I learnt to be compassionate, even when it's very difficult. And most importantly, I learnt to break my own mental barriers and now I can take on life with a different perspective.

Finding the way towards a more conscious life in Sadhana Forest
Feb 2024 • Solo
I came to Sadhana Forest expecting to learn more about reforestation and water conservation techniques, with the aim of understanding how my ecological footprint impacts the Earth. Although this expectation was met, I was also warmly welcomed into an accepting and unconditionally loving community of people from different backgrounds. In Sadhana Forest I got to know more about myself through meaningful interactions with others. The individuals I have met here were able to hold space for me and showed no judgement. If there is one thing I could take home with me from this experience it is the capacity we have to impact others through selfless acts, even a simple smile can change the trajectory of ones day!

Living sustainably in the forest with people from across the world!
Mar 2024 • Solo
I'm spending 3 weeks at Sadhana Forest, and every day I'm meeting lovely, unique people from all over the world. I've learnt so much in a short space of time - sustainably planting trees, maintaining compost toilets, conserving water, maintaining the culture of a community. At first Sadhana can feel quite different from our conventional lives, but after a few days of settling in, I really started to experience what makes this place special. There's nothing quite like living in the middle of a forest!

Bliss in Sadhana Forest
Mar 2024 • Family
Blissful Experience
Living in Sadhana Forest is an enthralling experience. Waking up to the sounds of nature, starting the day with warm smiles in a community of people from all over the world,  doing Seva , preparing healthy vegan meals, relaxing in the serene environs, learning about different cultures, learning and contributing to sustainable practices of living by conserving water and much more is what you gain when you come to this forest.
Being in sync with Nature, community living  & having healthy meals, works as a catalyst for one's own self growth. I was touched by the compassion way of living here, with people and animals living in harmony with each other. It's a delight for vegan travellers for getting all 3 vegan meals and an awesome vegan Masala tea made with coconut milk and Indian spices.
The pace of the day allowed me to unwind in the lap of nature whilst indulging mindfully in the volunteering tasks. It was amazing to learn and engage in conserving water by practising hand washing and cleaning utensils in such simple ways.
The accommodation is comfortable for toddlers and adults. An experiential stay, where each day feels fulfilled and blissful.

My Experience at Sadhana Forest
Mar 2024 • Family
The people here are very warm and welcoming to everyone. I felt like I was already a part of the community since the day I arrived. Obviously, the first 2 days I did take time getting used to the schedules but, by the 3rd day, I had adjusted quite well.
There are people from places from all around the world, and it was really nice to hear about their experiences.
At Sadhana Forest, they practice water conservation and reforestation.
The food here is vegan, and surprisingly it was really nice. We eat a lot of fruits which taste amazing and also keeps us hydrated.
It's so calm and quiet here unlike the cities with all that hustle-bustle and craziness, which is just nurturing and peaceful for my mind.
I would definitely recommend to stay here to get away from the chaos and just to experience life in the forest in a productive manner.

Whirlwind of fun
Feb 2024 • Solo
My time at Sadhana forest has been a whirlwind of fun and learning. I had no idea about this place before coming to Auroville. A friend told me that he wanted to see and go on the tour around a sustainable living community. I was happy to join him and after Luke, a long term volunteer, told us about the impact that this place has, I paused my tour around India and signed up to volunteer for 10 days. I have never made a better decision. From reforesting to tending the rescue cows, each day has been a blessing and my mind has never felt so balanced in my life.

On my first day I was welcomed in with open arms and was given the full run down of the week ahead. I was impressed by the division of sevas (selfless daily activities) and how they made the community almost completely self sufficient along side the reforestation project. These community tasks and the reforestation projects really help you bond with other volunteers who all have a similar mindset; that they want to make a positive impact on the wildlife and community in the area. Even though it has only been 10 days, I have made friendships here that I can tell will stand the test of time. Sadhana forest really has a family feel here and I can now even consider it a home.

On to the food. A guilty admission, I am neither Vegan or Vegetarian outside of the forest, but have been cooked and served a wide range of incredible foods that I would never have tried myself. From peanut butter pancakes to Thai green curries, the food here has been excellent. There has even been a request here for a Sadhana forest cookbook. I regularly drink alcohol and I have never been particularly spiritual in my life (another guilty admission). However coming here has enlightened me to other ways of living, some of which I will implement into my every day life. There is such a strong community feel that time flys by and the urge to have a beer or glass of wine with dinner completely goes.

On a side note, you will struggle to find a better deal than 600 rupees a day for food, accommodation, entertainment and a wide range of workshops all run by volunteers. For 10 days, that’s 6000 rupees, which is £60 for the whole experience. Absolute bargain if you ask me.

No matter if you are coming directly here or only passing by, whether it’s to volunteer for 10 days or 6 months, Sadhana forest will be worth your trip. It is an excellent insight into what conscious / sustainable living looks like and will teach you how it is even possible. The stay itself has given me the opportunity to explore Auroville in more detail as well as feel part of a like minded community. You will meet amazing people, have a great laugh and do some work that will actually feel meaningful. I can only thank Sadhana forest for the opportunity to volunteer here and would highly recommend to anyone else!

Planting trees in vegan community. Highly recommend :)
Feb 2024 • Solo
I stayed in Sadhana Forrest for 3 weeks in february 2024. It is a peaceful, friendly and healthy place. It was a marvelous experience and I would highly recommend this to anyone!

Forest.

You will have the experience of staying inside the jungle. It is wonderful to be waken up by the birds singing. Staying inside the forrest maked me calmer and more connected to myself. You can also contribute your work and go planting or watering the trees on the morning.

Connecting with people and community leaving.

During my stay in Sadhana I met many people from around the world. We spend a lot of time working together, eating together and having great conversations. Sharing joy and difficulties together was a great pleasure. I hope friendships i made in Sadhana will last for a long time.Quite often people were making workshops on different topics so it was never boring. I enjoyed this community life much more than isolated life the western culture!

Veganism and healthy lifestyle.

The food in Sadhana is 100% vegan. Very fresh and unprocessed. The meals are delicious and give you power for work. After couple of days I started to enjoy not drinking coffee, cause feel more healthy and balanced. Suprisingly I even found it good to wake up early cause you can observe beatiful light after the dawn and the day was so long. During the day it was rather busy so I was not using my phone that much, which makes me more calm and mindful.

Trying yourself in different tasks.

During my stay in Sadhana I was watering small trees in the forest, cooking meals for community, preparing the fire wood, cleaning after meals, serving people food, helping at the cow sanctuary, serving at the tea hut and not to forget cleaning the toilets. Was wonderful to try myslef in different tasks, to work manually and to see results of my work.

I had really good time in Sadhana Forrest. Before I come i was bit tired of travelling and my stay in Sadhana helped my to get grounded and a little bit feel like at home. Hope I will come back one day!

Visit or Volunteer here, you won't regret it!
Feb 2024 • Friends
Sadhana Forest is a truely unique community. The scale of the positive change that is made here is monumental.

This change is generated by the hard work, good will and compassion of such dedicated action oriented volunteers. It feels wonderful to be given the opportunity to contribute to this change in such a real and tangible way.

I've been so inspired by how well community aspect of Sadhana functions and the fact that this can exist in tandem with such strong social and ecological change fills me with real hope for the future.

Life in the forest is not luxurious. The way human needs are facilitated are so well thought out. Here you don't need to try to reduce your impact. All the systems from hand washing to food preparation are designed to automatically reduce your environmental impact. And give so much opportunity for reflection on your impact when outside the forest.

I stayed at Sadhana only 2 weeks, in that time I feel I measurable change in my level of compassion, my willingness to help other beings and my sense of purpose. This place attracts truely beautiful human beings and the relationships I've formed have left me feeling more connected then ever.

If you're looking for a place to do good and are up for some hard work (seva) come to Sadhana. I can't recommend it enough.

Life changing
Feb 2024 • Couples
Excellent reforestation project that continues to develop and I think they have the solution to major problems in the world such as the climate crisis and animals being exploited as a resource.
There are many social events to get involved with being provided by people from cultures around the world. A truly eye opening experience.
Their values are closely aligned with mine, using a gift economy instead of a monetary system, compassion, non violence.

Stay at Sadhana forest
Jan 2024 • Solo
I heard about Sadhana from a friend who had visited earlier this year, who had explained about it’s uniqueness of experimental living and sustainable approach. The plan was to stay for 4 days but it’s been about 3 weeks now and I’ve never felt a sense of gratitude envelope me this way. .

It’s been quite a journey especially connecting with wonderful people who have come from different parts of the world to share and learn about sustainable living ( linked to veganism), reforestation, water conservation and most importantly compassion which is taught through and through in every seva we partake in and to treat the animals around you the way you would treat yourself which is with love and respect.

The immense shift from the normal way of consuming media through your laptop or phone screens and working 8 hours a day to make ends meet to a mindful living where you are working towards basic but important needs such as cooking food, planting trees, ensuring cleanliness and promoting sustainable living for a better future. The simplicity of life here eliminates the question of what’s your purpose or how you can be someone of greater value instead encouraging you to be grateful and mindful in every action

The focus is on selfless service and putting materialistic gains on the backburner. The idea of compassion can truly be understood here living in the forest that’s always giving. I’m humbled and in awe with the way of living in true unity and seeing hands on work being encouraged in an age where we are all behind screens. Thank you Sadhana for being one of my biggest mentors and giving me more than I could ask for.

Volunteering at Sadhana
Feb 2024 • Solo
The comfort zone of our daily lives makes the mind dull and makes life very monotonous. For me, Sadhana Forest is to get out of my comfort zone. It makes me feel very vibrant and gets me out of the rut of my own thinking process.

The whole place is designed to throw you out of your comfort zone, right from the dry toilets to living in a shared dormitory with fellow volunteers to working together in different sevas where you cook food for the community or clean utensils in which food is cooked or taking care of the forests and the community etc

The non judgmental space that this place provides one is another major reason for me to flock here again and again. Majority of the people who one meets here have in someway broken away from the established pattern of the society and they understand each other’s mental struggles and provide space for everyone to just ‘be’ and not be this or that!

The sense of community that one feels here is something special. All the activities and the structures are thought out in such a way that people come together and get to know each other. Human relationships are a marvellous thing once you get a taste of it!

I also like how people are not in a rush to achieve here. Their concern is with existing now and not with the ‘what next?’

The slowness of life here is what I really admire and would like people to experience as well. Happy volunteering if you make to Sadhana :)

Wonderful conscious community
Jan 2024 • Friends
My experience at Sadhana Forest has been wonderful! The community of volunteers is very strong, kind and generous. The most beautiful aspect of Sadhana Forest are the connections that you form with people from all around the world. The community attracts a diverse range of individuals, all who are consciousness and warm. I enjoyed living simply and spending time in the forest with my animal friends! We participated in daily volunteer work, in areas that supported the maintenance of the Sadhana Forest community (sometimes foresting, other times cooking and cleaning). Eating delicious vegan meals together was a favourite part of my day, and rewarding after challenging work. The community is very organised, and so adjusting can be difficult. However, I felt well supported and cared for. I would recommend staying for a minimum of 3 weeks to feel integrated in the community.

Living in a forest
Jan 2024 • Solo
Coming to sadhana forest was something that I gifted myself with. This place offered me much more than just an forest experience. I came with a list of things to learn starting from reforestation, water conservation, sustainable lifestyle, living in a community and to name a few. I liked the non-judgemental environment that is offered by the place and people. It made me feel very connected to the nature and for that I'm very grateful. The conversations and people had a huge impact in my pursuit of purpose. This place offered me to channelize my thoughts and give a direction to venture out into the unknown with my recharged self and disconnected beliefs.

Sadhana forest
Jan 2024 • Friends
My experience in Sadhana was great overall, living in the forest for 10 days away from the city and in a vegan friendly environment was amazing. I really loved that.
It is also a great family friendly environment. The long-term volunteers are always available to answer questions and help if needed.
You help around the forest for around 5 hours per day in the morning (+2 afternoons a week) and you get accomodation in private hut for couples and families, or in dormitories for single travelers. You also get three big meals a day: big breakfast with fruits, lunch and dinner.
Beside that, I met incredible people there that I will definitely keep as friends.

Fantastic immersion in sustainable alternative lifestyle

Sadhana Forest and it's People
Nov 2023 • Solo
A volunteer wrote "Let there be more forests to grow people." and this for me is an apt definition for Sadhana Forest and it's people. The sevas are very intense, there is so much work that on somedays it can push you beyond your comfort zones. It takes a lot to grow and maintain a forest, and at the end of the day, in sweaty t-shirts, getting through another day feels very cathartic... I come back to this place every few months, and every single time, I meet amazing people. The conversations that we have here are unlike any other place that I have experienced, it has burst all my bubbles and changed my outlook for life. There are so. many. amazing. people out there, it just blows my mind! Dear reader, if you feel like you want to connect with people who are challenging the system and showing us a way of sustainability, and of kindness to everyone we share this planet with, then this is the place for you.

A sanctuary away from the chaos of city life
Dec 2023 • Solo

Sadhana Forest has been a transformative escape for me, a sanctuary away from the chaos of city life of Delhi. In just three days, the serene embrace of the woods has untangled my mind, leaving me feeling very lighter. The profound shift in perspective is a gift; here, life is lived with compassion and a focus on health. Amidst the trees, a diverse community converges, each individual contributing to a cause that extends beyond personal well-being. Sadhana Forest is not just a retreat; it's a communal endeavor towards positive change. People from various backgrounds unite in a shared purpose, fostering an atmosphere of unity and understanding.

The allure of veganism, explained and embraced here, becomes more than a dietary choice—it's a harmonious way of living that extends kindness to animals and the environment. Contrary to common misconceptions, embracing a vegan lifestyle need not be expensive, even within the confines of a city.
This place is a beautiful haven where introspection meets action, creating a ripple effect of positivity. As I bask in the lightness that seeps from within, I can't help but envision a future where more individuals, seeking solace and purpose, find their way to this sanctuary in the heart of the woods.

The Journey towards change and engagement.
Nov 2023 • Solo
On the 14th of November, 2023, I was fortunate enough to begin an inspiring journey in Sadhana Forest, a wonderful vegan community that magically filled 36 days, precisely 3,110,400 seconds, of my existence with extraordinary experiences. This community, loaded with the essence of acceptance and altruism, enveloped me in their arms and offered unfathomable love, rendering my stay in this idyllic sanctuary simply phenomenal.
Venturing into this journey, I had the exceptional chance of participating in the illustrious Plant 4 India fellowship program that the forest offered. The opportunity not only ushered me into a world of learning but also gave me the privilege to bring about a positive impact on this green community. This whole experience has been significant in shaping my perspective towards life and strengthening my commitment towards veganism.
In the realm of this amazing odyssey, today marked a day of double joy. It was not just the commemorative birthday of Sadhana Forest, but also the day of celebrating the loving union of long-term volunteers, Abhilash and Sandhaya. Participating in these celebrations, reveling in the festive spirits of the community, and imbuing myself into these delightful moments has left some indelible footprints in my heart.
In conclusion, my stay at Sadhana Forest has been a blend of many stirring emotions, learnings, and heartening experiences. These moments have enriched me, teaching me the importance of community living, organic food cultivation and highlighting the beauty of the place where kindness and love are the only currencies. I look forward with eagerness to the remainder of my days in this forest, and to all the invaluable lessons that await me in this sustainable paradise.

Brilliant reforestation efforts with delicious vegan food served
Dec 2023 • Solo
The extent of the work being done on reforestation of the arid, dry landscape is phenomenal. Would recommend Sadhana Forest to Naturalists, bird watchers, vegans and anyone who enjoys spending time in Nature and with people from varied cultures, languages!

My experience of Sadhana Forest
Aug 2023 • Solo
Sadhana Forest to me is a home with open doors. A sustainable vegan community with warm hearts and an intention to engineer compassion in every thought process. A day in Sadhana Forest starts at 6:00am where we join in for the morning circle and then choose our sevas (selfless service). Morning sevas could include planting trees in the forest which is so much fun with our community friends. We dig trenches, discuss about native trees and learn so much from the Forest Manager. Another seva I love is the Gaushala where we have so many cows who are all rescued cows. Feeding and brushing them just brings me so much joy! We shower them with love and care so that we can take away any memory of abuse in their past. Other sevas could include kitchen hygiene and cooking meals for the community where we all sit at the kitchen table chatting away as we help the chef. The meals are completely unprocessed, vegan food that will make you crave for a second and also third serving! After breakfast, we choose sevas that help with the general upkeep of the community, like accomodation, compound, toilet cleaning etc till it's lunch time. Afternoons are mostly relaxed and we hang out with friends, attend fun workshops to learn new things or go for a dip in the amazing mud pool. I personally love to curl up in the hammocks and read for a bit till it's 4:00 pm and delicious vegan tea and laddo is served at our tea hut! I have changed for the better and my life will never be the same again. I will always have Sadhana Forest in my heart wherever life may take me. I urge everyone to pay a visit to understand kinder ways to exist on this planet which is our only home.

Alternative Life in Nature
Aug 2023 • Solo
When I first arrived in Sadhana Forest, I knew I was in for a truly unique experience. I have been curious about learning more about sustainable living and veganism, Sadhana Forest felt like the best place to be. This is my first time living in a community and it has been amazing staying with like-minded people who are very open and accepting.
My journey at Sadhana Forest began as a fellow for Plant4India, a program that focuses on water conservation and reforestation in different villages in India. Through Plant4India training and forest sevas, I learned how to understand the land, dig trenches, make mounds, and plant trees. The experience was very grounding and I felt really good working with the community in the forest.
The dedication of the community to sustainable living is truly inspiring, and I experienced it through the compost toilets, hand washing stations, zero waste bins, and the huts (and many more). Walking through the lush greenery, I could feel the harmony between humans and the environment. The passion and care that the community pours into nurturing the land is a powerful reminder of the impact we can have when we prioritize the Earth.
Sadhana Forest is a place for anyone who is seeking a closer connection with nature and a path toward personal growth. If you are someone who is looking for an escape from the hustles of the city, I definitely recommend Sadhana Forest as it offers peace and a unique way of living. Life here moves at a different pace, I loved waking up to the soothing sounds of nature, feeling a deep sense of peace I hadn't experienced in a long time.

Experience for a lifetime
Aug 2023 • Solo
My experience was unique because for the first time I felt like everyone could allow themselves to be true and authentic, while usually in society humans hide aspects of themselves in order to fit in. I resonate with the community’s values a lot, veganism gets supported, there’s lots of love for animals. Core values are compassion, unschooling, giving, seva and so much more. During the sevas we had lots of fun and I enjoyed the forest and goshala the most. Every day I had the chance to decide which seva I’d like to do. I felt very respected as a human being and enjoyed all the different workshops (sharing circle, non talent show, etc)

My amazing stay at Sadhana forest
Jul 2023 • Friends
If you want to be surrounded by a forest tucked away in Auroville with a bunch of strangers but still feel perfectly at home, then Sadhana Forest is the place for you.

I came here for the community values, to be surrounded by nature, to eat fresh organic food and mainly to be a part of a community that valued all these. I got all these and many more, I served my minimum period of 4 days and going back feels like I'm leaving home.

I'm so grateful for this place because I'm taking back with me so much more than I could ever even imagine. I hope to come back and join this place for longer and if you're reading this review, I really think you should come here too, I'm sure you'll find something you didn't know you were seeking for.

Excellent
Jul 2023 • Friends
I'm a 19 year old, who came to Sadhana Forest with one of my friends as a volunteer and I met lot of people from different backgrounds and ages!

All the days of my stay here, I did activities while being mindful and calm. I could notice that I became a very interactive person and was patient enough. It is a really great place and the people here are welcoming.

I'm excited to share this to my friends and bring them here! I'm sure they will enjoy the little details and funny stories that I will share. But most importantly, they will want to hear about my experience so they can make a more informed decision about whether or not this a good fit for them.

Beam of hope
Jun 2023 • Solo
The commitment to prioritise low-impact living practices, implementing off-grid systems, vegan gaushala, dry composting toilets, and solar energy solutions is what initially drew me towards Sadhana Forest. After coming here, I realised it’s completely true.

I wanted to be a part of a collective action where I can be reminded every day, that together we can make a difference in restoring and preserving the ecosystems; and Sadhana Forest fulfilled that for me.

The most beautiful thing here to experience was a sense of being in a family. Having support from volunteers, from all around the world, who have come together and share their experiences, values and skills. It’s amazing how I got to learn so many things, through different perspectives & approaches while doing sevas.

Here, people accept you the way you are, without any judgments or willingness to change you. I never felt I had to put a mask on here, and try to blend in this community; I was able to be real and raw and also experience others as humans first.

Working in a vegan gaushala, cow sanctuary, was a unique experience. From learning their traumatic past experiences about how they have been rescued; to earning their trust and knowing they can communicate with you, be it in any language. They know their names, and will come to you as you call them. I assumed it would be difficult and a very long process to build a connection with all the cows and bulls, but talking to them gently, giving them space and loving them is the key I learnt.

Mind opening experience
Apr 2023
I heard about this place a long time ago, and was finally able to come volunteer a few months ago. I was expecting a lot, and yet I wasn't prepared for all that I experienced here.

The most incredible thing about this place in my opinion is the community. Living with people who all share the same values, are here for each other in the most compassionate way possible, and all striving for the same purpose is the one thing that was truly missing from my life before. Being independant is not a requirement in this life. Being able to rely on a small group of people, live with them, share anything with them and know that whatever happens, they will accept me for who I am is actually so much better. The concept of gift economy was also something that made me see the world in a different way. Giving to others without expecting anything in return, knowing that everything in this life is available in abundance and using that abundance to spread as much love as possible. That's something I never even thought about before, so stuck was I in our current system.

The second best thing is nature. Living here is not living in nature, it is being a part of nature, just as much as any other animal living in this forest. You can directly see the consequences of every action. Washing your hands? It waters the trees next to it too. Same for washing the dishes or showering. Cooking and eating? Anything that would be thrown away is given to the dogs, cows or composted. And all of it makes the forest greener, denser and full of life. We are nature, and nature is all around us.

I would recommend this place to every single human being on Earth. Some of it could be hard to get used to for some people, but the positives are so overwhelmingly amazing that stepping out of your comfort zone to come here would be worth it. Simply a life changing experience.

Transcendent experience
Jun 2023 • Solo
I’ve know about this selfless pocket of green for a long time but to actually experience it in person is like eden.

The serenity of the forest washes over you, inspiring you to be the best version of yourself. Growth Is a corner stone of Sadhana Forest.

Personally, the city life just got too overwhelming and I needed a space to escape to which would allow me to self reflect and grow. This community, their ideology, and my interactions with like minded people and the forest itself really helped facilitate this.

To be a part of nature in such an intrinsic way, and to give back to the community and forest felt transformative - the metamorphosis I so desperately wanted seems so much more tangible now.

Apart from the self development, to really feel part of a community (even within the short span I was here) and work towards something so much bigger feels really fulfilling and nourishing to the soul.
Being an architecture student I feel so much more confident applying the sustainable techniques that I learnt during my stay in my practices.

Coming here was a truly transformative process for me and I would urge everyone to visit at least once in their life.

The best experience
Jun 2023 • Solo
We all look forward in life exploring and experiencing different things. And that's how I initially reached Sadhana Forest.

This place felt more like a place where I belong to. The people here are the warmest people I have ever met. This place helped me connect to nature better than before, it helped me connect with myself more deeply and with the community too!

Living in Sadhana forest helped me understand nature, the vegan food that Sadhana Forest offers helped me connect with my body and health much better. Sadhana Forest is surely a place where I would like to raise my kids. It is a place I would like to settle down at. Sadhana Forest is a place for everyone.

Would I recommend any others to go to Sadhana Forest? That would be a 100 percent yes! And if someone asks me why one should go there, I would say that you will find your own answers once you get there.

My journey of Enlightenment
Jun 2023 • Friends
Sadhana Forest has been an awakening to the absolute truth of conscious living, which created such an incredible sense of awe within me.

Here, I get to awaken my senses and use my eyes and ears to see the raw beauty of nature and to listen to the sounds of native wildlife and experience it by living in the present.

This creates such a sensation of amazement throughout your day and it gets your adrenaline pumping by doing seva.

One learns how to actually live their life to the fullest. This is something that I have always looked forward to, and now I have found a place where I can give all of me to Mother Nature.

An immersion into nature and sustainability
May 2023 • Solo
Sadhana Forest was an amazing and unique experience where I got the chance to deepen my knowledge regarding sustainable living and also be surrounded by the kindness & wisdom of so many like minded people! The food is a dream and the community is based is amazing values such as non violence, compassion, gift economy and non competition.
I highly recommend to anyone interested in reconnecting back to Mother Earth and nourish it in a regenerative and sustainable way. I know I’ll be back for sure eventually one day and I’m so grateful that I had this experience.

Surprise yourself
Apr 2023 • Solo
The story of how this forest came to be is absolutely incredible, as are the stories of each and every individual who helped and continues to help sustain and grow this haven. Since people from all over the world come here to volunteer (many of them for years), one feels curious and excited about what this place has to offer.

This forest isn't just another getaway from urban civilization or a thrilling adventure to have, it is a way of living itself. Here, one can not only find the joy of community and harmony, but also an opportunity to rediscover themselves. Whatever background you may come from, whatever story you may have, the forest and its inhabitants accept you lovingly. I, personally, did not want for anything more than I had while I was here.

As by only experiencing can one fully understand any concept, so by only giving can one receive many times over. I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who is reading this to visit Sadhana forest and to give a part of yourself in service to nature and all its beauty. You only stand to be pleasantly surprised. I wish you the best!

Life At Sadhana Forest
May 2023 • Solo
So I visited Sadhana Forest because I was a little confused about my life and I wanted some time alone to think about all the issues happening in my life. I needed to find an answer to them and I always wanted to have a more minimalistic life that is connected to nature but I never had the chance previously.

When I learnt about Sadhana Forest, the life I imagined and never experienced, I finally got the chance to try it. I packed my bags and came to Chennai from Udaipur, Rajasthan.

So if you ask me now, if I achieved what I wanted in Sadhana then the answer is YES! Outside of seva, I get my own free time to be explore my interests. I also got the first-hand experience in helping take care of the forest and animals, like the cows and dogs here. The food they serve here is pure vegan and it is very healthy and I feel that my health has improved.

Great community living & learning experience
Mar 2023 • Solo
The community is the best part of Sadhana Forest. It's a dynamic community centered around compassion and sustainability that expands and contracts all the time. But the friendship and comradery are always constant. It is a place where the east meets the west in perfect harmony. I left my country 44 years ago, and this is the closest I have come to "home." The hardest part is saying goodbye to friends.

Sleeping huts are comfortable and rustic. Made of all natural material. My first impression was Robinson Crusoe's hut. Waking up to the sound of birds is the best part.

The food is great. Plant based whole food. Just my style. The breakfasts are heavenly with so many different types of fruit. Other meals are a mix of internal cuisine depending on the lead cook. No one goes hungry here. Most people socialize during meals. I usually eat mindfully in silence.

Goshala is a unique experience.
"The place of cows." Every cow and bull has their own personality. It can get exciting at times, especially around meal times. Most of them love to be brushed. They actually show you the part that they need brushed. And tell you when they don't like something or when they're done.

The tea hut is the most amazing place. The ambiance is great. It reminds me of the old west. The servers are awesome, too. I jokingly refer to the pair as the cute bar girl and the boundaries. A place to unwind and socialize.

Conscious Living
May 2023 • Family
The experience I had here made me realise how we can still be kinder to every living creature and how I can coexist. It was an amazing exposure for my 6 years young daughter to get to live in and being cared by mother nature and it's elements and she learnt how to care for it in return. We have a LOT of take aways definitely to implement in our daily lives. It just lit my conscious a bit more and I feel a lot of blanks got filled up. Being an unschooling family, a community like this, I had always been looking for. I am glad my daughter found a home in nature with a wonderful caring and conscious living community. So grateful to have got a chance to be the part and contribute something through seva to remain the part of this place forever. A warm stay with a lot of memories for life. Coming back soon..😇

Out of the box
May 2023 • Solo
Sadhana embodies the values it stands for.
It reflects in each person, who is residing there, and that's a difficult feat to achieve,
And as the name suggests if you wish to truly let go of the self, and engage in selfless practices it's the right space to be.
Also personally, I have felt disconnected from my body due to the nature of my livelihood and the kind of highly cognitive livestyles we live in. The few days I spent there helped me to stay grounded with my body, and just forget the daily grinds and be attuned to nature at its rawest.

Life in the forest
Mar 2023 • Couples
I have learned a huge amount after spending several weeks in the forest and I believe my life has been changed, in big and small ways, because of it.

To start with the big things, I learned, firstly, what it means to function as part of a collective. Everyone works together in selfless service to maintain the community and grow the forest. The result is that no matter how much I give, I always feel like I recieve more. Additionally, I discovered a model for living which doesn't cost the planet. I thought I was already environmentally conscious as a vegan who avoids excess consumption etc. But until coming to Sadhana, I didn't consider the impact of my toilet, my hand and clothes washing facilities, my meal choices, and so much more. (Or if I did consider them, I didn't believe I could implement them as I didn't have a model of people who were living this sustainably). I will not be able to continue many of my pre-Sadhana lifestyle choices that are taken as a given in England.
Moreover, the story of Sadhana Forest generally inspires me in life. It's hard for me to believe that this thriving community was once just 1 family, and the huge forest was once barren land. Experiecing the impact of a small group of people who wanted to create change gives me hope. Also, knowing this first hand gives me more confidence in myself to do bold actions than if I read about it.
I could go on, but I'll end the 'big things' here.

In terms of smaller things: I've made deep and rich connections, I've gained tons of creative food recipes, I've met all sorts of wonderful forest animals, I've developed lots of budding interests from workshops offered by volunteers, I've become much physically and mentally healthier, I've learned about reforestation.

Thank you Sadhana :)

Life changing experience
Mar 2023 • Solo
Volunteering at Sadhana Forest is a life changing and eye opening experience! The place just makes so much sense. They are doing their best to create a wholesome way of life, in harmony with all humans, animals and plants! Anybody is welcome to volunteer year round. You can help in their work of ecological regeneration and sustainable living. There is an animal sanctuary, a Children's Land, a tea hut, a weekly Eco Film Club. The community life is very nourishing and enriching. You live, work and hang out and have fun together with people from all over the world. There are daily social activities.

Sadhana Forest is built on very strong values, trying to realize a conscious lifestyle: substance free living, veganism, zero waste, non-competition, unschooling... I never encountered any place that combined so many of these powerful tools that help us overcome our discriminating mind, and push us to live a life that is inclusive towards all forms of life! I cannot recommend this place enough.

A Better Humanity is Possible
Apr 2023 • Solo
After one year since I started my project researching Utopian Community and “Humanity”, and marching for Peace and the Planet, I finally arrived in Sadhana Forest in Auroville.

It has been so precious to live in the forest, volunteer for it, and eat non-processed vegan food and meet so many amazing people along the way. I loved every moment despite the hot season. So precious to volunteer for reforestation in a compassionate and kind environment that matches all of my core values.

A place you definitely should not miss!

Home away from home. Sadhana forest
Jun 2021 • Friends
Usually when you go somewhere you get excited toward the end of the trip to come back home. But after staying at sadhana it left like I was leaving my home to go out somewhere else. In such a short time everyone there felt like family to me. Everyone must visit sadhana. I’m definitely going to keep going back. No other place feels like Sadhana to me. I’m a short amount of time I’ve grown and changed as a person. I’m so much more aware of everything around me and had like a reality check about what’s going on around the world.

Sadhana forest experience
Jul 2021 • Solo
The community living , cooking n eating together- vegan ,millets, no chillies, almost nil oil and a well balanced one at that.
The birds.and a few animals visiting you, yet you feel safer and happier being one with them.
The goshaala experience is really satisfying..
The dry poo pans , water conservation methods and creative tools are worth memtioning , composting - the perfect 'zero waste ' practices , need of the.hour!!!
Mudroom is the most amazing fun element.
So much of good vibration , kindness and compassion around is a great take away too!!
Loving it all here ..

Sadhana Forest
Jul 2021 • Friends
It was a one of a kind experience. The community at the Sadhana forest was very welcoming. It was a surreal experience which drove me to rethink my choices and encouraged me to be one with nature and give back to mother nature. With veganism, unschooling and the concept of gift economy as some of their core values, this place is a must visit.

Transformative, pioneering community project, with a little bit of everything
Mar 2020 • Solo
Sadhana forest is a vegan community based on a few very human principles. In my personal opinion, this is a great suggestion for how humans can live and thrive together.

In a humanity that's growing constantly, trying to expand, explore, function, improve, I felt the need to leave the everyday bustle of Copenhagen in Denmark to go try something different. I initially wanted to volunteer at this place because of the reforestation that they are doing, but when I got into the rhythm of this place, observed and partook, I started to realize how much more there was to do here; to learn here! This community is more than a reforestation project. This place is booning with humanity. Not the humanity I was used to from back home, where everyone always has a million things they need to do, and even more things that they want to do but can't because of all the stress they put themselves/are put under in modern society. This humanity was closer to what I consider the core of us.
Here, we practice gift-economy. Not just in the exchange of things do we want nothing in return, but also in exchange of favours, actions, a hand here or there. It's about being together about it, helping eachother out, not trying to earn your rent. We even have a free-store where we can drop off clothes we don't need and take whatever we do need, and a library where we can lend books free of charge.
We take care of eachother. When we get sick, we tend to eachother, bring food and spend time making sure nobody is ever lonely.
We eat together - all of us - and eat only vegan, for the sake of the animals, the planet and ourselves. We are also raw-diet friendly. The founder, who lives here with his family, eats a raw diet.

Promoting this compassionate way of thinking and being is being highlighted even more as a big part of my life while being here. Probably also due to the wonderful people who come here. That's what this place is, after all - a collective, family, tribe, whatever you wanna call it - and it is only because of us that it remains and still functions after 16 years.
If you also want to try another way of living, a way that focuses on giving, enjoying, helping eachother out, appreciating beauty in the human, nature, and the relationship between the two, come to sadhana forest and live with us!

Sustainable community working on ecological revival
Mar 2020
I have travelled a lot in my life, but I have never come across a place like Sadhana Forest! I have been here now for a week and have already learned so much about reforestation, community life, nature, zero waste, vegan cooking, unschooling, etc. And I just planted my first tree this morning! It is so amazing to wake up to the beautiful singing of the birds amidst nature, getting to know people from all over the world and support a project which is not only turning a desert into a forest again, but has also a lot of positive impact on the local Indian community. Sadhana Forest supports a non competitive environment, in which everybody can explore their own talents and preferences and even present them at the "non-talent show" once a week. Being over 40 my minimum stay would have been only two nights, but I will definitely stay longer. If you love nature and community life, I highly recommend to come to Sadhana Forest!

A serene place to experience
Mar 2020 • Solo
I've lived in Sadhana forest for a week now, and I cannot express my gratitude for the impact the community has brought onto me. More than living in a secure forest area, it is about taking back spiritual values for yourself. If you are reading this, you must come and experience this place at least once in your lifetime. The food here is fantastic and very healthy vegan.

Wildlife in a community
Mar 2020 • Solo
Sadhana forest is a good place to learn how to live close to the nature and in a community. Where you also learn how to take care about the forest and the animals. Moreover it's a beautiful place with huts and a mud pool.
To be more precise, here I feel that there is a real community life because we do lots of activities together and we really work for the community and not for ourselves. The place has also a deep soul which is easy to get close to, so I could feel very fastly integrated. Even if there are lots of rules, which are necessary for the community life but it took time for me to understand some of them, it's possible to get involved and have responsibilities very easily. Moreover I feel that I learn lots of things everyday thanks to the people here and I still have enough time for myself which is necessary. The sharing here takes place with all the generations, from children to aged people, and with different animals like cats, dogs and cows. Ok my free time I really love staying but it's also easy and nice to go sometimes to Auroville which takes like 15min by motorbike.
Even if the place is very clean and well organized, there are still the usual discomforts of mosquitoes and bad smells of the compost toilets. But this is part of living close to nature and being respectful of it.
Finally, here you really never get bored thanks to the library, the workshops volunteers propose, the WiFi connection, the work for the community, the visitors who come daily and the rich nature around. The food here is also amazing, it's a great place to experience your relationship with it.

What a beautiful learning experience
Feb 2020 • Couples
Wow. I’ll never forget the moment I entered the Sadhana Forest the first Time.
I found myself surrounded by so much lovely and positive energy!! I felt life. I felt the energy of the people in terms of growth. Internally and externally. And you can literally see it. Just by looking around you. Everywhere trees. The fact that around 15 years ago there was only dust and now everything is green instantly gave me hope and inspired me in such a positive and powerful way.
I definitely knew from this moment on: „yepp - i‘m definitely in. I want to volunteer here.“

I quickly understood that here I‘m able to find a great way to grow personally and learn so many things about myself and others. About nature and our life.
Now - after 3 weeks of volunteering I can definitely confirm this.

Here you have the space to really put a mirror infront of you and to deeply reflect on your own personality and the world and what it means to live life in a community. Therefore it is also in fact a social experience. You are surrounded by so many open-minded people. You can easily talk to anybody about your emotions or what ever you‘re struggling or thinking about at the moment.
I had so many great conversations with people here. Important conversations.
I‘m so thankful for this time and experience here and will always carry this with me.

I can only encourage everybody to go and visit this place. And maybe also you will feel a connection to this place as I do.

Thank you people of Sadhana Forest.

Reconnecting to the source
Mar 2020
Sadhana forest is a special place who drawn me here without me looking for it.
I had the intention of keeping on living sustainable, in harmony with nature and surrounded from people who shared the same values of life and that are willing to inspiring and supporting each other's.
Somehow I ended up on the sadhana forest website and something clicked inside me and I knew instantly I should have come here.

So here I am and since the first moment I totally felt home.
I love how we are able here to reconnect to the natural source in an authentic way.
For many people who might have lived all their lives in cities it might be a drastic change but also the only way to really understand how many conditioning we have and how much we think the only way of living is the one that we are used to be comfortable with.
The best way to "see" things differently is through direct experience. Nobody can make you understand what it means with words.
And just with simple buckets showers which is also super fun :) you can gain awareness through experience of how much water we truly waste without even realise it with a simple normal shower.

Here you can reconnect to nature and learn to give back to it and not just taking from her.
Honouring and respecting our earth through planting trees, conserving water and practicing awareness in what we consume and the waste with produce.
We take care of the land and their animals recreating the natural native forest of this region.

This project and community has an healing effect to people. The feeling of being able to express themselves freely and feel part of this whole family again.
Compassion, non competition, self less service and gift economy (working and giving without expecting nothing in return) are some of the core values that create this sense of wholeness with everyone in here. Every Wednesday night we have a non-talent show where everyone can share everything they feel like feeling the support needed.

Come and experience and then take what you feel to take with you and share with others.

All my gratitude cause this part of world gave me:
Another time in my life where I've been so lucky to find a place I can call home.
Another time in my life where I've found people I can share unconditional love and being inspired from.
Another time in my life where I could experience a glimpse of the feeling of being part of the whole again.

German guy seeking for a unique communal experience
Mar 2020 • Solo
Hi,
My friend suggested me a place in India that was without a doubt the best experience of his life. Me, a young, energetic guy who is always seeking for new adventures to get me out of my comfort zone, made my way to india to look for that place. Out in the forest close to Auroville there is this magical community with even more magical ambitions: making the world a better place!
So how is this exactly working?
By reforestation, veganism and zero waste (especially focusing on water)
, we are trying to raise awareness to our impact on the environment.
Me, who went vegetarian half a year ago, has no problem adapting to the vegan food, which even offers a way larger variety to what I normally eat. Being in this community definitely helps to overcome any kind of issue and makes you feel at home, even though you are at the other side of the world. There are always people who look out for you and are giving you a heart warming feeling (the morning hugs are definitely helping).
For me, this is a place of knowledge and to find myself what I really want to do in life. If you are struggling with that as much as I do, then you should definitely go to Sadhana and get a clear head.
Hope to inspire you and raise awareness of a really beautiful place on Earth:)

Great Community with an effective approach to water conservation.
Mar 2020 • Friends
I spent a week in this community with my study abroad group and got the opportunity to learn about environmentalism through a hands on approach.

This community eats a totally vegan diet, and uses only biodegradable soaps and cosmetics so this is something to keep in mind before spending time and volunteering here.

All of the community members take pride in the service they do and are happy to be contributing to the success of this community. Everyone is welcoming and eager to get to know you and your story.

Amazing Gap Year Experience
Oct 2019
I am currently travelling with a gap year program based in Portland, OR. Our theme this season is sustainability and spirituality. As for the sustainability portion of the trip, we were given the opportunity to spend a week here in Sadhana forest. To keep it brief, I'm going to summarize the pros and cons of our stay here.

PROS:
- extremely welcoming and kind community
- great (vegan) food
- secular community
- daily free workshops ranging from improv to yoga to salsa dancing
- close to Pondicherry and Auroville in case you want to explore surrounding cities
- great way to expose yourself to what a truly sustainable community looks like
- very unique and life changing experience as a whole

CONS:
- the weather is hot and dry, and they don't have AC
- schedule can be rigid such as waking up early to work around the compound and needing to be on time to meals
- only compost toilets, biodegradable toiletries, and non-processed foods
- bugs and critters such as dogs, cats, and cows

However, if you are willing to put in the work and commit to a sustainable and higher-consciousness-focused lifestyle during your stay here, I highly recommend it.

Beautiful experiment in Compassion!
May 2019
I visited Sadhana Forest for the first time in 2013. I have since stayed at the project four separate times and have been volunteering here for more then a year now. Over my time here I have met thousands of people from around the world. I have come to deeply appreciate the uniqueness and opportunity of spaces like Sadhana Forest. The project is driven first and foremost by values. The idea is not that everyone should have the same values, but that by staying somewhere that seeks to practice every aspect of life with integrity and dedication that we in turn learn about ourselves. The ecological work being done in Sadhana Forest is fantastic and is evidenced by the absolute transformation of the land. What cannot be measured is the effect of bringing together people from all different backgrounds from all over the world to collaborate towards a common good will towards the planet, all of its inhabitants (including domesticated and wild animals!), and., of course, to ourselves and everyone around us. The effect is creating a place for growth, which is driven by heart and not scarcity and fear. Sadhana Forest is a beautiful place to cultivate hope in a world that desperately is searching for a reason to change and to fight for our values and our belief in a sustainable and nurturing world. Come give us a visit sometime!

Volunteering in sadhana forest
Feb 2020 • Solo
Im volunteering in sadhana forest for a month allready, and i can say this place changed a lot about the way i see things in our world and society. It made me understand living simple life is not only possible, but also amazing. One of the main values leading the project is ecological sustainable way of living, in which we use the minimum amount of water, creating beautiful compost from the food leftovers and the toilet, not using any plastic and eating 100% Vegan non processed food. Living this way, i feel im giving back to the nature, instead of just take and take, when there is no more to take from.
We also Do massive reforestation in the land surrounds as.
The voluteers are amazing people from all over the world, and everyone influences in their own special way. Im here only one month and feel a lot like home. Doing somthing so meaningful and learning so much at the same time.
In this times of climate changes and global warming, we have to make a massive change in our life, and sadhana forest is a torch we can use lighting the way out from the big mess we made, and finding the way back to nature.

Evolution
Mar 2020 • Solo
I didn’t know much before coming to volunteer.

It’s truly what i’ve been missing/seeking. a community based on ethics and love. open space to share skills/knowledge. reforestation with water conservation techniques. different activities all the time all fueled by delicious vegan food!

As a gay, atheist, vegan, feminist. Ive never felt more at home and challenged at the same time. The non- judgement and welcoming i have received almost feels other worldly in such a big group of people. not one single negative reaction to any of those labels. I feel seen and accepted. more than that i feel included and cared for.

As a vegan I knew this was the next step for me. I was reducing my impact but wasn’t giving back or anything more than that. I feel a sense of purpose a goal and passion ive been lacking for a very long time.

im contemplating becoming a long term volunteer. I am falling in love with this place and want to learn as much as possible to share this back home!

thank you Sadhana!

An inspiring vegan volunteer community
Feb 2020 • Solo
I came as a volunteer to Sadhana Forest to learn more about the projects and have more experience in living in a community.
After joying the tour they provide at fridays, you will hardly not fell inspired by the methods used in the largest vegan volunteer community in the world!

Here the philosophy and goal is to make the difference and to help the planet to become a better place.
Community, veganism, reforestation, self-sustainability, decolarization, gift economy, zero waste, seva (selfless service) and projects in crisis zones (Haiti and Kenya) are the mains words I can use to describe this place hide in the forest.

Without a doubt, it is a place of passage for those who want to visit the space, share a meal with the community, become a volunteer in the short or long term. If you want to know more about this type of project, what it is like to live in community and how to help in this real ecological issue we are facing, as inspiration in your life's space or here!
Everyone is welcomed and there is room for everybody!

Sadhana Forest
Mar 2020 • Friends
Sadhana is an inclusive and accepting community focused on environmental conservation and sustainability. Everyone is very welcoming and makes new volunteers feel at home immediately. Since Sadhana is located within the forest, it's provided me with the greatest since of peace and quiet I've experienced since coming to India. The community's goal is not only to live sustainably, but also to change the world through reforestation as well as education about lifestyle changes. Everyone staying in Sadhana works together to reach these goals and to keep the community running. On weekdays every member participates in two "sevas" before lunch, which are essential tasks that keep Sadhana functioning. The first seva that I participated in was helping to take care of the ten rescue cows that live on the property. The cows are very sweet and basically act like extremely large dogs. They will come push their heads against you as a way of showing affection, and many love to be brushed and pet. Sadhana Forest is a vegan community, and after spending time with the cows and having conversations with many other volunteers I began to question my choice to consume animal products. Although being at Sadhana did make me think about my lifestyle choices, I never felt any pressure from the people here to take on a vegan lifestyle outside of Sadhana. Despite not being vegan when I came to Sadhana I found all of the meals delicious and filling.

Get To Know Nature and Yourself
Feb 2020
Sadhana Forest is a vegan, eco-friendly community that promotes reforestation. People come from all walks of life to learn how to live sustainably, support animals and plant trees. It is a great place to come to get to know yourself as you get to know people from different backgrounds. Throughout the experience, I have learned many new lifestyles habits to help, not hurt, the environment and people around me.

Living in the future
Mar 2020 • Solo
 I do not know where to start to explain how happy I am about my experience in Sadhana forest.
From an outside look, it is already amazing : living in a more sustainable way, work on reforestation and water conservation, experimenting new lifestyle with values more respectful to the environment, to human beings and to any other kind of beings such as veganism, gift economy, non violence, unschooling. Therefore there is much to learn about all of it from the volunteers, the founder, the books...
And I was much more than that living with the community for 6 weeks. Thanks to all this inpiring values and the inspiring people attracted by the place, I learned a lot on myself, being able to take some great decision for my life because I also finally had the time to work on them. It feels to me that I can live here an healthy, happy, stress less life while doing what is needed for the environment right now.

Sometimes, I feel like Sadhana forest is almost to beautiful to exist, and I would definitely recommend anybody that feel interested by it, to come and check it out. If you are open minded and open to change, you might have one of the strongest experience of your life.

Inspiring place, inspiring people, life changing experience
Mar 2020 • Friends
Inspiring place, inspiring people, life changing experience. I’ve has the opportunity to visit Sadhana Forest a few times and each time I’ve been grateful for the inspiration that comes with the experience here.

Sadhana is a conscious community, made up open people who are putting their beliefs into action to make the world a better, more compassionate place. They are also actively engaged in reforestation-to combat climate change and deforestation. A stay here will expose you to an alternative (or actually better, holistic, realistic way of living) way if living:vegan, zero waste and with compassion as a core value.

The impact of the place is in the practice. They don’t need to preach, rather, by learning about the many detrimental effects of modern polluting industries, the answer seems clear. Also, it was through my stay here that I became more aware of my own consumption and it’s detrimental effects on the environment. It would be hard to come here and not experience a perspective shift. And that’s the beauty of it. Even after you leave here, the perspective shift stays: that there is an alternative way of living that doesn’t harm the environment or it’s living beings.

I’ve had the opportunity to share the Sadhana experience with college aged students, and for them the experience had been life changing as well. This is a place that will welcome all, and share the beauty of a compassionately lived life with anyone who walks through the doors.

Is this the real life or is it just forestsea?
Feb 2020
This place is so amazing that I don't even know how to begin!
I saw on their website that they were only giving tours on fridays and was already sad because by then I would already been far away when I decided to just write them an email to see if perhaps something was possible anyway. In less than 24hr I got a warm reply from Victoria full of details on what their schedule looked like and telling me that they would be happy to have me any day! I couldn't believe it, next day in the morning I was there, sharing breakfast and helping in the second seva followed by lunch and a small (but exhaustive tour of the place given by Richard). In very few other occasions I felt so welcomed and part of something. What they are doing is truly amazing and it shows! Only amazing people are capable of such things. They live by what they preach and while helping mother Earth they are also really careful about the footprint we all have as individuals. Zero waste, intersectional, full of love and against every discrimination.

Loved every second I was there!

A place for growth
Feb 2020 • Solo
I have only been at Sadhana forest for a week, but already I have learned soo much from being here. It is not only a reforestation project, but a community with a lot of love, drive and creativity. This project signifies alternative ways of living, with sustainability and well-being of all life forms as a pervasive philosophy. The direct moral feedback of planting a tree, the spiritual satisfaction of selfless work, the purity of a vegan and sober culture, the wonderful people you get to know here. It all accounts to a peaceful state of mind. It’s been a while since I felt so healthy and fulfilled.

The direct impact of reforesting 70 acres of endangered tropical forest in 16 years is huge, but even more significant is the inspiration that comes with it. Thousands of volunteers like myself stay here and learn, and tens of thousands more get inspired from visiting or learn through other channels. Sadhana is a movement, and I realise how important it is that more people hear about initiatives like this. Just being part of it is priceless and everyone is welcome.

Reconnect with your self and your environment
Feb 2020 • Couples
I heard about Sadhana Forest a while ago but I didn't really know what to expect and if I want to stay a month at one place. So I first came on the friday tour to have a look at it. The tour is offered by Sadhana Forest for free every friday. They pick you up and show you the whole place, explain you everything and are open for any questions. After this there is a eco - movie night followed by an amazing vegan dinner where you can connect with volunteers and get to know more about the personal experiences at Sadhana Forest. The tour really touched and inspired me so I had no doubts anymore and I decided at the same day: I definitely want to stay a month! I already felt that the place is spreading a really special energy, is following great values and offers you so much to learn. You experience that it is possible and even very enjoyable to live a zero waste live and not only this but even giving something back to the world by reforestation. Your personality can grow so much in this project not only by the sevas (selfless service instead of "work") but also by being part of this wonderful community. You live together with people from all over the world, everyone has a different background and different skills which are often shared with everyone interested by giving workshops.
So I came here to stay for 4 weeks and I love it. It is such a beautiful place with beautiful people. Everybody is taking care of each other you integrate very fast, learn so much from each other and about yourself and your doing something that is truly meaningful.
In Sadhana forest a giving economy is practiced which truly leads to happiness. Pure giving without expecting anything in return is wonderful, we do not need to fear that there will not be enough for ourselves or that we might lose anything by giving. There is enough for everyone and giving brings people together and creates happiness.

I am very grateful to be here and be a part of the project now. I already feel how grounding this experience is. The vegan food is kind of healing your body, gives you more energy and increases your health, the sevas and the life in the community gives you the opportunity to reconnect with your core values and live aligned with them.

If you want to get an impression of Sandhana Forest I can truly recommend you the Friday tour but everybody is welcome to visit at any time. There will always be a volunteer to show you around and you are always welcome to join for breakfast, lunch or dinner and you can even try out the sevas. I am sure you will not regret it and maybe you even feel attracted to this place and want to stay longer.

I am so grateful for this experience here realised by this amazing project and the wonderful people who support it. <3

Do you remember how we all used to play in the forest?
Feb 2020 • Solo
What a magical place to visit. No matter if you have 5 minutes or the whole day, Sadhana forest will greet you, give you a warm hug with its branches and stroke your soul with passion of people believing with their whole heart, that we can live peacefully and sustainably as a part of the nature. Sadhana forest is a place where people believe in true giving and they are happy to share with you delicious chai in Tea hut or any meal in the community, which is very family friendly and respectful towards children.

I strongly recommend to join Friday tour, where you will have a chance to see the forest and learn about how the community works and about it's values (like unschooling, veganism, non-violence, zero-waste, etc.). You will have a chance to eat purely vegan food, scrape your plate with ash used for cooking and crown your visit using dry toilet that is at the same time designed to be used for nurturing the soil.

You can also come and become a part of Sadhana forest just for one day and see what is the place about. Breathe and laugh with the volunteers while planting trees, see and help with the community's daily life or swim in the mud pool (which is not only one of the greatest attractions for children of all age but also a way how to capture rain water).

You can simply come and let yourself be inspired by the place and you can be sure, that once you'll come out of the forest you will not be the same person, who walked in. You will take with you a little piece of loving kindness of the people, cows, trees, birds, dogs, cats, ants, bushes, butterflies and frogs living in Sadhana forest.

Love kindness compassion hope
Sep 2019 • Solo
Sadhana forest- I dont think I've found right words as of yet to show my gratitude for everything I've experienced here. Came here not knowing what I was looking for or what exactly I was getting myself into. I've found more about myself in last few months that I've spent here than entire rest of my life. Truly life changing journey full of learning and growing and meeting so many amazing people, hearing their stories, receiving so much love. When people are loved for who they are, they heal. That's exactly how I feel. Sadhana forest will be my home forever no matter where I go.
I've learnt the true meaning of compassion here. I realised being compassionate to my friends, family or people around me is not what compassion is while I pay money for animals to be butchered just so I can eat meat. I've spent all my life chasing the kind of happiness that fills my heart, finally I've felt that hole being filled by people's kindness towards each others, animals, environment. Sadhana forest for me is like opening a door to unknown and then finally realizing that should have opened this door long long time ago. Now, I know giving selflessly is what true happiness is. It brings you so much joy and satisfaction. I've made friends and family for life here in such short time.
I've been here for almost 5 months now and have taken part in almost everything that's done here and it can only be described as amazing learning and growing experience. It can be challenging living with volunteers coming and going all the time but I've met so many kind, caring, loving, compassionate people here that it's my big crazy family now and I've learnt to accept every one for who they are and love and respect towards everything we do here.
I believe if we can learn to be compassionate towards all beings and start putting same value to all living beings, we will automatically learn to be compassionate to each other as humans and we can stop all this unnecessary suffering of people, animals and the planet. We work so much better together than against each other. We can make a massive difference if we start putting compassion into everything we do.

Being at home at Sadhana Forest!
Feb 2020 • Solo
There’s a positive mind, heart and spirit experience available to those staying at Sadhana Forest, helping carry out the daily seva offerings whether planting trees, tending them, cooking meals, helping care for the beloved animals or having some wild fun making costumes from the Zero Waste Hut for a “Trashion Show.”

From the early morning sounds of birds and neighbors’ soft voices to the loud squawks of gorgeous wandering peacocks and full conversations (over the 3 healthy vegan meals made and served each day); from the moments of silence to the tunes of guitar, accordion & flute music drifting in and out - there is learning, there is magic, and there is healing in the air.

And then there’s the mud pool. It almost should be kept a top secret. But we like to share our abundance here...& the Mud Pool is a delight to share: refreshing, cool and warm in different spots and fun as can be! and like so much else here it has an intriguing history and sooo much went into making it.

I love it here and find the long term volunteers, residents and staff here very welcoming. They are informed, passionate and committed to carrying out the vision and mission here. And the mission resonates with me - ( in my own words) to restore the water table, to reforest the once severely-dried and degraded land - and to eat vegan and live lighter on the land and on our own bodies with home made organic meals and no caffeine, processed foods, nor alcohol or smoke.

Plus there’s the founder’s words about the living experiment here to “ engineer compassion.”

I recommend you check things out, take a tour if you can, and then come stay here at Sadhana Forest some amount of time to feel what it’s like to be part of an ever-evolving successful international community.

You can jump right in to experience and help create a more sustainable, non- violent lifestyle and share this model of hope with the world. It is a happy thing to be at Sadhana forest, even if we have sad moments too. 🌳🤗

place impossible not to LOVE
Feb 2020 • Friends
An absolute treasure not to be missed if you find yourself wandering around Pondicherry/Auroville! The most welcoming community that makes you want to stay forever.. It's a vegan community based on volunteering planting trees, taking care of rescued cows and dogs and cats, living sustainably and with the maximum effort to not only protect the environment, but enrich it! First we came with my friend on Saturday for the Potluck, which means free DELICIOUS vegan food for everyone, and the following week we did the Friday tour, during which we learned all about the beginning of this project and the way of living her.. and few days later we came back to help for a full day - planting some trees, fixing termite holes in the huts and enjoying the great food with all the volunteers- which made me decide to come stay with the community for a month! I recieved the warmest welcome and felt instantly as a part of a family - and it feels so good to participate in something meaningful in company of many many beautiful people. Can't wait for all the things that are about to come!

Beautiful Sadhana Forest
Feb 2020 • Solo
Having arrived in Sadhana Forest with little prior knowledge but following my curiosity - after a recommendation by a fellow traveller - I simply rocked up and was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful energy with which I was greeted and the scale of the project. Taking a mini tour with a mid term volunteer (main tour runs every Friday at 4pm) I got my bearings, enjoyed lunch with the community and felt incredibly welcomed - a home away from home.

After lunch, I spent some more time exploring on my own, relaxing in the meditation hut and plunging into the mud pool. A beautiful evening followed consisting of dinner and an optional sharing circle for which I stayed having previously planned to leave mid afternoon. This magical forest had sunk its teeth in - I simply couldn’t leave. The warmth of the local community blended with Sadhana Forest volunteers from further afield was refreshing and very welcoming - with all ages and a deep love for the environment and human connection, it had a strong family feel. With no money changing hands and not a donation box in sight, this is a beautiful example of the gift economy practiced here. This made it an easy decision to check-in the following day for a month.

So here I am, a week into my time here and loving every minute of it: practising seva (selfless service) each day - planting trees, cooking, cleaning and many more - demonstrating gift economy and living simply in a loving and inspiring community of people from all over the world. Impressed by its ethos and one of the most beautiful attractions in the Auroville area, this will always have a special place in my heart. After this initial month, I will almost certainly return and/or visit one of the other projects in Kenya and Haiti.

A volunteering experience where you can help reforest the world.
Feb 2020 • Solo
First and foremost Sadhana Forest is a reforestation project. It has been running for 17 years when it was once an arid barren landscape, and it is now a beautiful forest paradise full of birds, flowers, frogs, and volunteers from all over the world.

This is a powerful project which is addressing the climate emergency, and is putting compassion and ahimsa into action.

But is is much more than a forest - if you come and visit you will see the amazing main hut where all the volunteers eat three delicious free vegan meals a day and have eco film club on Fridays, the kitchen where all the food is made by volunteers, the huts where we sleep, the mudpool where we go swimming, the library full of free books... And a real sense of community.

Most volunteers stay here for 4 weeks, some for a few months, and some for years. It is free to stay at Sadhana Forest, and there is a small daily contribution for food for those who can afford it.

If you want to come and find out more about volunteering here, come along for a free vegan meal! Either 8.45am, 12.45pm, or dinner at 6.00pm. You can talk to the long term volunteers about the incredible work which Sadhana Forest is doing to change the world for the better.

Come and be a part of this wonderful part of the world.

Amazing Sadhana Forest
Feb 2020 • Solo
I came to Sadhana forest in order to volunteer there.
This is such unique and special place.
Living for few weeks in a vegan community, planting and watering trees, taking cares of the cows, taking care for how much waste I'm creating (with wish to create zero waste),taking care for my use of water, not wasting any food since we share our leftovers with the cats, dogs and cows- all of those actions are part of the daily living in Sadhana forest.
I highly recommend to come visit or volunteer there.
You are always welcome in Sadhana forest, you can join any of the meals during the day as you wish (all vegan non processed food made with love and care), you can join the tour that runs normally every Friday, you can join the potluck- an event that runs every Saturday in which you can come and enjoy vegan food as well as bringing your own vegan dish and of course you can come and be a part of the community for a month or more.
Sadhana forest is an amazing place, one of a kind where I've learned a lot.

Sadhana forest
Feb 2020 • Solo
Sadhana forest is a community made from all different kinds of people who are living together by the same values they share.

The care for the nature,animals and environment is amazing like nothing I've seen before.
It's a good place to explore and examine the life you live right now in a way which is less damaging to the earth.
I've only been here for two weeks but I'm already thinking about extending my stay.
If you are in the area you are more than welcome to join the free tour on Friday, there you'll get all the information about the place plus an ecological movie and a meal.

A step towards a conscious lifestyle
Feb 2020 • Solo
I came for a visit and stayed for 4 days. I loved my stay here and I'm looking forward to coming back for longer.
The people here are really friendly and supportive, there's great community spirit, good healthy Vegan food cooked in the kitchen. The sevas include jobs like planting, watering trees, cleaning, cooking, cutting fire wood, etc.
Sadhana Forest is sustainable in every way possible and great attention is given to all the aspects of the lifestyle here. It is a truly wonderful initiative in this time of climate emergency to create awareness and help fight it.
It's is a truly life changing experience and has made me reconsider, and live more consciously.

Must come
Feb 2020 • Friends
Had an experience of a lifetime here. Suggested by a friend, Sadhana Forest turned out to be a gem. You never stop learning here. The community is really friendly and helpful. The environment over here is peaceful and away from the city rush. Had an amazing experience doing 'seva' and got to learn many many things about the forest. Everything's well organised and planned, be it the ambience or how it works overall.
You encounter animals every now and then, the good part being that you can play with them. Cats, dogs, peacocks can be seen frequently. There's a lot to take away from here, an improved and better consciousness along with the understanding of forest and water conservation.

I was so impressed I was shattered!
Jan 2020
First of all, animals are treated there with respect and love, nothing less. It is a convinced vegan community, that says a lot.
Apart from that, we were received with joy and enthusiasm, although we were over 150 people on that visit. Our guide held a fiery speech at each stop ouf our guided tour (about issues like compost toilets, unschooling, sanctuary for abused cows and planting tree saplings in a dry ground), then we got a free concert and free meal, all on the declared grounds of gift economy.
We got the impression that volunteers are happy there and that it is a community that really works and even has the capacity to receive guests every day. Moreover, they do great work that benefits the region and all of humanity. Respect amd awe!

Feb 2020 • Solo
For the past few weeks I have been living in Sadhana Forest. I came only to volunteer and found that there was so much more to it. I became a part of a receiving community with amazing people from all over the world.
I lived in the middle of the forest, Iearned a lot of easy ways how to be a better person for our environment, ate great vegan food, enjoyed afternoon activities and met new friends from all over the world.
Even the tough work was satisfying.
At the end I extended my stays even longer!

Sadhana forest
Feb 2020 • Solo
Sadhana forest is a special place where a community of people who believe in morals and values, the environment and water saving lives.

The lifestyle in the community is vegan (Also suitable for non vegan people)

Throughout the day you can volunteer in different places within the community such as planting trees, caring for cows and more.

Every Friday afternoon a bus comes out of Auoville for a tour that explains about the place. Then watch a documentary movie and have dinner together.

On saterday, many people from the area come to the tea hut and have dinner together.

A magical place that allows you to look at life from a different perspective than life outside

A great intro to sustainable living
Nov 2019 • Solo
I absolutely adored my time here at Sadhana Forest, there truly is something for everyone no matter the age or level of ability. I recieved such a high level of fulfillment from helping with their reforestation effort, assisting with the cooking and just doing general upkeep around the community. There are a lot of activities to keep you busy even during the down time such as the Eco Film Club on friday nights, followed by a free vegan dinner for everyone attending, and the potluck on Saturday evening which is also free for everyone. They are more than happy to have guests visit and take a tour around the community or just to join them for a meal. It's a great way to live off grid with sustainable housing and solar power, I really cant recommend it enough

Sadhana and ahimsa
Feb 2020 • Solo
I spent 5 weeks in sadhana forest and it changed my life. Being surrounded by so much compassion and warmth helped me to realize what I really want to do with my life. Doing selfless service to the community everyday without expectations pulled me away from the competitive, selfcentered thinking from our society. And in the end i gained so much by giving a part from me away. People supporting me, Helping each other, living simple and compassionate lives. You think its not possible or too hard? You should come and visit. You will be surprised.
There are many options here to learn about permaculture, animal care, veganism, unschooling, gifteconomy and more. By experience or by Workshops and talks.
I learned how to care for the cows in the sancturary and deeply fell in love with these beings. Come and cuddle some cows:)
And I have to add: the food is amazing and jumping in the mudpool is the best.
Its a great place for people all ages and backgrounds. The community welcomes everyone and shares food, housing and skills.
I will Come back to this place, a place that already feels like home, if I have the chance. See you there!

Sadhana forest
Jan 2020 • Solo
It is my first time in Sadhana Forest near Pondicherry.
I was informed about the place and the community life by a friend.
My daughter first visited this place 2 years ago.
She was a changed person when she came back .
She began to live a simple life , appreciated all the privileges in life And was greatfull and thankfull.
I was inquisitive to visit this place.
I managed to take time off and with lot of Apprehensions visited this place.
I felt odd the first day, surrounded by friendly strangers, I ate a simple vegan dinner and went to bed in a hut with no electricity and used a toilet with no taps or flush.
It was not so difficult the following days to enjoy sevas such planting trees, lunch preparation, firewood cutting , goshala cleaning, zero waste management .....
The community is not just friendly but was inspiring to see people of all ages participating in work without any expectations. It is true Karma Yoga.
Life after seva is simple, reminding us how privileged and blessed we are, in this planet of abundance.
Everyday activities such as bathing, laundry and cooking are kept very basic to remind us that we need to respect the resources of this planet and preserve it .
It feels great to live in close connection with nature with cows,dogs, cats, peacocks, squirrels,frogs birds,bees and butterflies.
The core values of sadhana Forest are compassion for animals, unschooling and respecting this planet and its resources.
They believe in gift based economy.
There is fun too - with non-talent shows, informative movie nights, informal bon fires , a relaxing mud pool, yoga and a meditation hall.
You can meet local people from close by villages on potluck evenings on Saturdays.
I recommend this place for anyone who needs to meditate,introspect and rediscover oneself.
Also if you miss your grandfathers farm life and want to remind yourself of what this planet used to be not so long ago, do come here.
There is still time to save the planet and save all life !

Sadhana forest: Heaven on Earth
Jan 2020 • Solo
I recently volunteered at Sadhana forest and without a doubt I can say that this place influences your life in many small ways.
This place helped me to change the way I look at things and to become a more responsible human towards the mother Earth. It made me aware of many small actions and how they can create an impact towards a better living.
Apart from all these things, Sadhana is place to have fun and interact with people of various nationalities. Just by listening to people's story you get to know about the things that you wouldn't have ever thought you'll learn.
There are various fun nights as well, so there's Non-Talent show where many people perform or make the audience perform and it's just too much fun to be a part of such activity and then every Friday they host eco film night.
There's not a single moment where you'll feel bored or left out. Everybody at Sadhana is very welcoming and considerate and they make sure you're having fun in the community.
And not just fun but this place also heals you mentally and makes you a strong being. Every Wednesday they have sharing circle where you can share about anything and everything and there's no judgement,no feedback and no opinions, just pure non-judgemental sharing to let anything that's struck inside you to come out.
And the best part according to me at Sadhana forest is the mudpool. Swimming in the swimming pool is too mainstream and nothing mainstream happens at Sadhana, So they've a mudpool and the mud is really good for your hair and skin. There were days where I would apply mud on my face and hair and just relax and have a sunbath.
This place is not just for volunteers but for everybody, even if you're around pondi or auroville, you can just pay a visit and have a meal over there. And trust me, food here is really really good and healthy.
I'll highly recommend everyone to visit sadhana atleast once to try this alternative and lovely form of living and you'll see a change in yourself.

Remarkable community committed to the earth
Jan 2020
I have been staying at Sadhana Forest for 5 weeks. It’s a transformative experience that not only gives me the break I need from the city but also recharges my whole being inside out. The core values of SF such as compassion, unschooling, gift economy, non-competitiveness deeply resonate with my heart. The seeds which were planted in me long ago finally received more nutritions and water to grow.

Though community living may not be something we are used to anymore, it is truly rewarding to grow deeper connection with people from all over the world. Collaboration during seva(selfless service) is a great way to connect & get to know someone. My favourite activities are tree planting and cooking for 60+ people. Each week there are core value talk, sharing circle, non-talent show, eco film club plus many other workshops offered by different people staying here.

If you happen to be in Auroville, should definitely come check out Sadhana Forest. Swing by to have a free meal, join a seva, or even stay for an extensive time to get a full experience of this remarkable community!

My favourite project in Auroville
Jan 2020 • Solo
I spent a little over a month here as a volunteer. I highly recommend coming to see this community, especially if one is visiting auroville. The best time to come is probably for the friday night tour. There is a shuttle bus which picks people up from the solar kitchen parking lot at 4pm. Dinner is included. People can come on there own and are welcomed for breakfast lunch or dinner.

"A forest to grow people"
Jan 2020 • Solo
Volunteering at Sadhana Forest is a memorable experience, and potentially a life changing one. It is a volunteer opportunity where you also live as part of a very special community. It is a perfect place to work on your own sadhana, and there is a lot of support for anyone who wants it. Volunteers come together three times a day to share a healthy vegan meal, and this fosters a strong sense of community and unity.
There are occasional workshops & events... yoga, non violent communication, Tai Chi, sharing circles, etc. The founders and long term volunteers at Sadhana Forest are passionate about the ethos behind the place and you will learn a lot during your stay. There is an inspiring weekly Q&A session with the founder, Aviram.

Work is from 6am until 12 noon, with a break for breakfast. There are many options for work: you can go into the forest to assist with the reforestation work or take on one of many support tasks around the community.
One of the many excellent things about this place is that all toilets are dry compost toilets - no water is wasted unnecessarily. Some people may take a few days to adjust to the no-frills living.
There is a weekly tour on Fridays at 4.30pm followed by a film and meal - ideal if you are unsure about staying but would like to look around and learn more!

Happiest forest home
Jan 2020
I have volunteered for a few months at Sadhana Forest and love it more with every day I spend here. There are so many aspects of the community to get involved with and I truly believe there's something here for everyone.

The sustainable, compassionate and collaborative way of life here is so inspiring and I wish more people could learn from this place and replicate the methods all over the world. Sadhana Forest is very unique and will always be a place I call home.

Volunteering at Sadhana with my children
Jan 2020 • Family
I agree, I am blown away by this organisation. All the volunteers really walk their talk and the passion that they share with so much skill is remarkable.
Don't expect only reforestation, it's also about learning about vegan sustainable cooking on the fire, permaculture throughout the day, when washing hands, when composting your waste, caring for the cows in the sanctuary and enjoying so much more sharing!
A must! No minimum stay for families but you should stay at least 2 weeks, maybe 2 years!? :-)

Peaceful and Serene
Jan 2020 • Solo
I spent a week in Sadhana Forest. One of the biggest and best communities in Auroville. Yep The best part of Sadhana Forest is the SEVA which is a Selfless service for the community, it’s an everyday activity(except weekend). After doing the SEVA for the first day I felt so good that this experience can’t be mentioned in words you have to come and stay here to understand it. The values that you learn here you can always take them back home and you will find a different kind of peace in your daily life.

Amazing volunteer experience
Dec 2019 • Solo
I was surprised by how quickly I felt at home in Sadhana Forest. The days are well-organized, and the communication is quite good. It’s better to arrive during daytime hours, when someone will be around to properly orient you, but it’s the sort of place where you could come in anytime and quickly feel welcome. Regardless of your reason for visiting, I’d recommend staying at least 2 weeks in order to get a good sense of how things work, and establish stronger relationships with people here. I’ve been here a month now, and even that feels quite short!
Depending on your background, some aspects of life here might feel challenging or uncomfortable at first, like using compost toilets, taking bucket showers, and doing laundry by hand. If you are expecting extremely basic or dirty living conditions, however, you might be pleasantly surprised. There’s a very regular cleaning schedule, handwash stations everywhere, and even WiFi in the main hut. (Segregated to one area, so if you’d prefer to take a break from technology, you have that option as well). Another big bonus is the food, which is abundant, fresh, and delicious. It’s a vegan community, so expect a lot of fresh fruit, rice, dals, and many creative vegetable dishes. Lots of bananas, too - if you are hungry in between meals, there’s a banana cupboard in the kitchen you can take from at any time.
The best way to understand the community here is by experience. Sadhana is a very love-filled, compassion-driven space. It’s a place to feel free in your thoughts and actions, and able to grow at your own pace, in your own time. Sadhana is a drug and alcohol-free space, which makes it an extremely positive environment for anyone looking to try out a substance-free lifestyle.
As a fairly introverted person, I was concerned that living in such an intense community would challenge my need for alone time. However, I’ve found there’s many opportunities for quiet space throughout the day, and many places within the forest itself to take a break from group activities. When I’m not playing music or chatting with other people, I’ll often go for a swim in the mud pool, take a bird-watching walk in the forest, or take a short bicycle ride into Auroville.
Sadhana Forest is an excellent place for anyone to volunteer, whether you are new to India, looking to experience a sustainable lifestyle, or interested in exploring the values of the organization.

A place where you live and understand the importance of sustainable living, compassion, community, food, veganism, the environment and our planet.
The people here work together towards the goal of reforestation and sustainable living. You can see how passionate they are and it’s inspiring.
The dogs, cats and the cows are lovely too.
Living here is an experience of its kind.

Great People, Amazing Setting, Unforgettable Experience
Dec 2019 • Solo
This was my first time experiencing community living and any nerves I had were immediately calmed by the amazing and friendly people that I met here.
I was warmly welcomed and made to feel at home from the very first second, you quickly allow yourself to be who you are as the atmosphere is completely judgment free and it is easy to bond with like minded people, each on their own journey.

The seva (selfless service) were very insightful and I feel like I’ve learned not just practical things, but a different work ethic as the work you do while here is for no personal gain but for the planet and the entire community to benefit as a whole.

Helping to grow the forest has been an incredibly enriching experience and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!

Sadhana forest- a must visit if you're in Auroville
Jan 2020 • Family
Being a volunteer here honestly changed my life. It has been the most amazing experience.
The values sadhana forest holds- veganism, unschooling, water conservation, alternative sources of energy, zero waste and reforestation really changed my perspective.
The sevas were a lot of fun as well and all the workshops and activities are so much fun and interesting also.
The non talent show, eco film night and vegan pot luck on Saturday are the highlights of the week.
I definitely recommend to come on the Friday tour which happens every Friday or just come as a visitor and have a meal and absorb the energy of this place.

"Let there be more forests to grow people"
Jan 2020 • Couples
My partner and I visited Sadhana forest for just a few days, which is more than enough time to come away with something special.
Throughout our stay we interacted with many local and foreign people from all over the world sharing the same vision and ideas of how we should live as a community, how we should treat our own bodies, and how we should look after our planet. As a reforestation project you can connect with the forest and learn how the ecosystem works. It also touches subjects on un-schooling, gift economy, animal rescue and water conservation.
We especially enjoyed the Q&A with Aviram (the founder) who enlightened us across these various subjects, especially Veganism, and the journey of the project.
It can be challenging but is without a doubt a very rewarding experience, living this very minimalistic/basic lifestyle.
Adjusting to the vegan diet was not a problem as the meals were plentiful and nutritious.
The living conditions are comfortable, if there was any concerns the volunteering staff were very eager to assist!
Sadhana Forest is a short distance from Auroville (20 min bike ride) where we could enjoy an array of amazing veggie/vegan restaurants, as well as not being far from the beach and Pondicherry city.
If you are wanting an experience like no other in India, I encourage you to come join Sadhana (phone or email or simply turn up unannounced, everyone is catered for!) Either to visit for their Friday Tour, or stay and volunteer. My favourite quote: "let there be more forests to grow people"
Thank you for everything and see you again!

Great place to walk
Dec 2019
The one kilometer walk to the viewing point was very refreshing and the upkeep of the forest was very good. Entrance to this forest is free but one needs to ask for it at the visitor's center in person.
The man who gave us the ticket looked at me and my wife - both senior citizens whether we would walk the one kilometer distance and we said we would and got the ticket. We did walk the distance and took a free ride back in one of their mini bus.

Sustainable living practiced - with thoughts for your own life
Dec 2019
If you are in the area, DO VISIT. Every Friday at 4pm a bus leaves 'Solar kitchen' in Auroville for a presentation + tour + communal dinner (takes about 4+ hours)

It is absolutely astounding what a few permanent residents and many international volunteers have achieved here: they reforested a barren area and the lush greens raised the water level by 6 meters in ca 16 years.
Volunteers live a vegan life, compost food, built compostable toilets, use only natural building materials - a complete circular economy. Most volunteers stay between a month or a year (there are minimums) - some come with children who are raised in a Summerhill-type "unschooling".
Everything is based on respect of nature and each other.
Maybe you cannot commit to that life (not easy) - but you can carry some of the thoughts into your own life - or support them with a donation (they do NOT ask for one at the tour.)

Best forest to visit
Oct 2019
It’s a great experiment for a sustainable future for generations to come.
One learns to realise how unfair we treat our planet and how we forgot to enjoy the simple things of life.
For me, sadhana forest is an earthing experience where we connect with nature again.
It’s great to see parents with their children (0—18 years) and let children see how important it is to leave a small ecological footprint.
The vegan whole food experice is a personal highlight, I really like it.
Not everybody is strong enough for this experience, so it’s really important to get a picture first, then only will it be an exceptional vacation/experience/learning adventure.

Come here and try it yourself
Oct 2019 • Solo
I came to sadhana forest because I was curious what it would be like to life in a community. I was not sure what to expect. I needed maybe one or two days to acclimatize. This is not because of the basic lifestyle but more because of my lack of preparing. After the first two days of getting used to the toilets. I absolutely love this place! It is such a safe place with no competition and no judgment. Everyone can be who one wants to be.

Beside the experience of living in a community I learned so much more! I learned about being vegan. I used to have my doubts about being vegan but staying here living this close to nature and the experience of the healthy change in my body really encourages me to stay vegan!

I can go on and on about the great people and the great experiences but stop reading this episode, just come over here and experience yourself!

I recommend coming by for the Friday tour; bus leaves from solar kitchen; free tour and meal. Then you’ll see what it’s all about. Deep sustainablility! And tons of volunteer opportunities. Don’t just be a tourist, come live and work here for a week or two or a month or two, and get to know the land. :)

One of my life's best experiences
Jan 2019 • Solo
A place full of love and compassion, where you do not compete against each other but cherish each moment of your life, sounds like a dream, but it exists in its true form, what we call Sadhana Forest. I had come there to spend a month but ended up living for three months. And today I call it my second home. You are in the middle of mother nature, adding more love to the surroundings. Seeing so many different bird species, traces of snakes, porcupines and many more on muddy pathways, breathing fresh air, not being surrounded by walls, having green everywhere; these are only a few of the details among many things beautiful about Sadhana Forest. They practice reforestation, water conservation, community living, gift economy, veganism to name a few. It is your inner Sadhana which happens once you are exposed to the world of hope and compassion Sadhana Forest is. You get the best food here, and the understanding of minimal living. I have made some very beautiful bonds in Sadhana Forest. It changed me, in the biggest possible way. It made me more human and taught me to love myself and others without expectations.
To sum up, you must visit this place if anything mentioned above is of even little bit of interest to you...

Adventure school trip
Sep 2019 • Friends
The place is just as described. Minimalistic living is their aim which is very efficiently being met.
People here are welcoming and warm and help you in adjusting to a sustainable life in the forest. There are several mosquitoes here but also sufficient mosquito nets covering the cots.
It may be a little difficult in the begining to adjust to the dry compost toilets (no flush) and the no tap wash basins and the toothpaste but it truly grants you a holistic experience.

Sadhna Forest made me realise the importance of protecting our nature and all the other natural resources we have. It's a beautiful and peaceful place that uses renewable sources to produce energy. The experience I have had here is the one I'll never forget. It's a wonderful experience and teaches us the importance of gratitude. I would recommend each one of you to visit Sadhna Forest atleast once as it is an amazing experience.

Jul 2019
Sadhana Forest is a place that I absolutely recommend for anyone visiting Auroville/Pondicherry. It is a reforestation project that is in the process of rehabilitating an indigenous ecosystem on the verge of collapse. They are also deeply engaged with the lcoal villages around - a community centre was set up at Sadhana Forest to serve the local villagers delicious vegan tea made from coconut milk. The water conservation measures have also profoundly benefited the neighbouring villages. You can stop by for a meal, tea, delightful conversations or just a tour and all of this is offered as a gift! No charge involved for visitors and the people are ever so friendly and helpful. It's hard to resist such joyous celebration of unity, hope and compassion. The Friday tour is expansive and ends in a delectable vegan meal and is highly recommended! There are many organisations that make promises regarding reforestation but Sadhana Forest walks the talk by not only planting trees but wholly remodelling people's lives and their relationship with Nature. And all this, with smiles!
Are you looking to immerse yourself, even for a few hours, in Nature? Sadhana Forest is the place to discover yourself and your connection to the world around you - people, animals and the planet itself!

Stayed here for a week. Such a beautiful place to stay. I must have stayed longer if there was no time constraints. Loved the place. Friendly staff, best location. Vegan food.

Gorgeous place with wonderful people
Aug 2019 • Solo
I visited Sadhanna for two weeks this summer and have absolutely loved my stay. Everyone is welcome no matter how long you stay: volunteer for several months, come for an afternoon tour or simply eat a free vegan meal.

The community spirit here is astounding. I have never been to a place where every member of the community (even if you’re here just a few hours) is equally valued and appreciated. I particularly enjoyed the Saturday ‘potluck’, where everyone is welcome to join and enjoy a lovely meal in a gorgeous sunny setting. Meeting people from across the entire globe is enlightening and you get a true insight into the local way of life as people from the nearby villages flock to try new food and chat.

Aside from the potluck, people are free to visit at any time and will be invited in to join a seva, have a tour or have a chat. People of all ages and cultures live here long and short term, so you will always find people to relate and talk to. I have loved getting to know so many people and sharing in such a unique experience.

Whether you are just passing through for a quick stop visit or looking for somewhere more long term to stay, I would definitely recommend visiting Sadhanna forest for the delicious food, astonishing setting, friendly people and the totally fascinating way of living and feeling.

A community of compassion
Jul 2019
When I arrived at Sadhana Forest, I didn't know what to expect. I knew it was a reforestation project and a vegan community but I soon found out that it was much more than that. Sadhana Forest is a community of compassion, of like-minded people from all backgrounds who share the dream of a better world and are figuring out how to realise it. It didn't take me long to commit completely to the all the sevas (selfless service) and to the values of this place and by doing so, I learnt and grew so much. Their main focus lies on reforestation and water conservation and those are taken very seriously, as they should be. But besides that there is a strong sense of community that bonds it all together, from morning to sharing circles. It's such a safe, non-judgemental environment where everybody is valued for what they can and want to give and not for how they perform in doing so. I had an unforgettable experience, had some of the best conversations of my life with the most amazing people and gained so much knowledge about alternative and sustainable ways of doing things. I'm taking with me so many "seeds" from this wonderful forests that grows people.

Our Transformation in Sadhana Forest
Jul 2019 • Family
We started unschooling our son Neel 2 years back in 2017, and in 2019 we have decided to travel with him. It is a sort of learning while travelling. The first name that came in our mind is the name of Sadhana Forest- a community in 70 acres of jungle - wow sounds interesting. Actually we have heard about sadhana forest from one of our family friends who stayed in Sadhana forest for 5 years.

We reached Sadhana forest in July 2019. We reached in the evening during dinner time and were welcomed by nearly 50 volunteers from different parts of the world. Let me tell u genuinely, the first day was a bit difficult. We have never been to community places like these and hence not used to staying with so many unknown people from different backgrounds, different cultures, and different languages. Also, life in the jungle is not easy, especially for us who are living in a Metro city like Mumbai.

Lots of initial discomforts - less electricity, hot weather, etc. Me and my son wanted to run away from this place immediately and we had decided to leave this place the next day.

Yorit comes to our rescue. Yorit is Aviram's wife (Aviram is the founder of Sadhana forest). She had a nice and fruitful discussion with us and suggested us to spend at least a week here so as to get the feel of this place. She suggested we accept these initial discomforts as a challenge and try to overcome them. Discussion with Yorit gave us courage and we decided to be here for one week.

Once we have took the decision to stay here for one week, we observed that slowly, slowly, all these initial discomforts vanished, and from the 4th day onward, we all have started liking this place and we have extended our stay by one week more. Today it's more than one month and we are still in Sadhana forest.

What should I say about sadhana forest ? It's a heaven on earth. Nature at its best. It's a home away from home with a very loving and compassionate family. I feel blessed to be a part of this family.
The best part of my long stay here is knowing Aviram, Yorit, his wife, and two lovely daughters Osher and Shalev.

I was amazed to know that Aviram is from Isreal. He came to India, fell in love with India , decided to settle in India , and completely shifted to India. He has acquired 70 acres of barren land which was like desert and transformed this barren land in to a jungle. It is a very inspiring life journey of Aviram and his family.

Another best part is the way natural resources like water and electricity are used here. For me it's a life changing experience.

My nine year son Neel is in love with this place. I feel Sadhana forest is the best platform for a Natural learner like him. He is basically from a vernacular medium but during the last one month his english speaking has dramatically improved. Earlier he was a little bit shy of a person but now he is very confident and has mixed with people very easily.

I think sadhana forest is a must visit place for every one . Anyone visiting sadhana forest should know that this is not a Resort and should spend at least 2 weeks here .

Such a wonderful place for children
Aug 2019 • Family
I visited Sadhana Forest three or four times with my five year old daughter during my first trip in Auroville from January to March. I was quite sure Sadhana Forest was the community I’ve been searching for to live in. So I came back this August to stay for at least one year with my daughter Dora.

I have to say Sadhana Forest is such a wonderful place for children. This is a place where children are appreciated, respected and nourished. They have the opportunity to be exposed to nature and learn naturally, without being pressured. They will eat the healthiest food and unhealthy food cannot even be found here. I can see how Dora has enjoyed her living here. She has become friends with all of the other children from different countries and they can always find something interesting to do in the forest or the huts. She’s been given so much love from all the volunteers in the community. I really appreciate it very much!

Beautiful place with beautiful humans!
Aug 2019 • Solo
I went to Sadhana Forest by curiosity and I wasn’t disappointed ! This place is just amazing! First, the place is very beautiful and peacefully. The Main Hut (and the otherd huts) is incredible. Also, the people are very nice and caring. There are a lot of good vibes here!
Just one thing: you need to be comfortable to wake up earlier ... because we start our Seva at 6:00 am! But don’t worry, you will awake with some music, and the Sevas are very nice (particularly when you are going into the forest to plant some trees!).
There are also a lot of activities: you can go to the mud pool, meditation hut, tea hut or just play music with somebody at the NON-talent show.
Anyway, i recomand this place to all the nature lovers who want to share some good moments with everybody !

From France for 2 weeks
Aug 2019 • Friends
I came here from France for two weeks. I was hosted very well by everyone. Everybody is very sympathetic, generous, helpfull, I found very quickly my place in Sadhana Forest. Although my bad English (ahaha), people were nice with me about that.
In Sadhana, you are all the time in the nature, outside, it’s very cool. I learned a lot of things about how to plant trees, the life in community, recycling, how to live without waste. There are a lot of very cool activies with people from all around the world.

It’s very difficult to recap my visit, the ambiance of the place, so come to Sadhana Forest !! And maybe you will see us because I would like to come back some day !

Make a difference!
Aug 2019 • Solo
It’s remarkable how sustainable living at Sadhana Forest has converted the 70 acres of severely eroded and arid land into a beautiful dense forest. I realised how our choices matter and by just being mindful about the resources we use on a daily basis, we can make such a huge difference.

We cooked together, we cleaned the forest, we planted saplings, we sang, we celebrated every day by being grateful to what we have.

A wonderful place to stay at

Sadhana Forest is an amazing community open to everyone where you can enjoy the nature and contribute to its sustainability through a vegan and zero waste lifestyle. You also have the opportunity to help planting and taking care of trees in the forest.
Compassion towards each other and the environment is at the center of this project where you never stop meeting beautiful people from all over the world.

Amazing, wonderful, beautiful Lovely place one MUST VISIT
Aug 2019 • Family
For me Sadhana forest is Heavan on the Earth. The space is fullll of love, compassion and highly energetic people. However one should spend minimum two weeks to really feel the energy, love and compassion. Very important suggestion don't leave the space without meeting Aviram and Yorit the founder of the this lovely places.

Sadhana Forest... Wow!
May 2019 • Solo
A group of kind, welcoming people, living a simple life in nature.

Great place for raising one's consciousness and going back to basics, educating oneself about ecology and of course living vegan.

Planting trees, cooking over a wood stove, cutting firewood. Important work on restoring an almost-extinct piece of indigenous tropical forest in India.

I recommend it to anyone wishing to be close to nature and live without cruelty to animals. Giving Sadhana Forest a couple weeks is absolutely worth it.

A great place to visit in the Pondicherry area
Aug 2019 • Solo
I had a great experience volunteering in Sadhana Forest this summer. From the first minute I got there, people were eager to help me and show me around. It is a great chance for solo travelers, couples, friends and families to live in an open minded community with solid core values and principles. You’ll never feel alone here.

At the beginning of the week we choose our sevas for the upcoming days, which means we get to decide what we want to do. Nobody will ever push you to do something you don’t want. I myself worked in the reforestation group (planting trees, picking up wood, mulching), I took care of the cows, I worked with wood, I cleaned the kitchen, washed the solar panels and went to pick up fruit and vegetables in the vibrant Pondicherry’s market.

Other than these beautiful activities, I had free time in the afternoons and in the weekend to explore Auroville, to swim in the mud pool or read on the hammock.

How not to mention the delicious vegan food we had three times a day, prepared by the volunteers themselves. And the night activities, social gatherings to stay together in the Indian nights.

I’m grateful for all the people that I met here and I sincerely hope to get back or to visit the projects in Kenya and Haiti.

Sadhana Forest
Aug 2019 • Solo
Sadhana is an incredible experience open for everyone who wants to try living really sustainable. The location Can
Be reached by bike,motorcycle car and tuc tuc and is close to food and Auroville amenities. In Sadhana’s hits you would have all the peace and the relaxing sound from the forest as well as naturally fresh interiors.

Sadhana is a vegan community devoted to offer very yummy lunches, breakfasts and dinners. There are many events, including open intellectual talks on interesting social topics where you can learn a lot from others experiences and prospectives.
Other events include, talent shows, music, open pot luck food night, tea shop and film night.

Sleeping is Sadhana requires a commitment of 2 days for Indian people and 2 weeks for Foreigners. To become a volunteer means doing two selfless services for the community, yes this includes tree planting, you can attend them as a GUEST if you are interesed on saturdays workshops.

I strongly suggest coming at lunch time to Sadhana or doing the tour and having dinner at Friday.
Is a special place where very concilia and lovely people live. You won’t easily find other similar pure and interesting place.

Enjoy the forest!

Sadhana Bliss
Feb 2019 • Couples
Volunteering at Sadhana Forest for one month was a life-changing experience for my partner and me.

We loved living in a community of people who were similarly interested in raising human consciousness and who were passionate about sustainability.

A sense of inclusiveness and human unity pervaded the space and I really felt that the people there tried to cultivate kindness and compassion in accepting and supporting every individual who volunteered there.

The best part for me was the seva that we got to perform every day. This selfless service purified my heart and enabled me to become an offering to others by doing a task with devotion and care.

I also had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of values that I hadn't really explored before, including veganism, non-competitiveness, unschooling, permaculture, zero waste and gift economy.

Wow! The Highlight of My Travels!
Jul 2019
Wow! The tour at Sadhana Forest was both fun and mind blowing. I cannot believe the before-and-after photos of this place. Through Veganism, volunteerism, water conservation, waste reclamation and sustainable living practices, they have regrown a forest in an area that was completely a desert.

I'm inspired to volunteer with these folks and will definitely recommend Sadhana Forest to my friends!

Hello Mjabouille! Thank you for coming to visit, we really appreciate it and thank you very much for your feedback! we are always trying to improve and grow Sadhana Forest, to make this place even more inclusive for everyone. If you have any ideas on how we can increase our interaction with local people, we would love to hear from you. It is very important for Sadhana Forest to be an inclusive place. We are always happy for anyone to come and join us here at any time. Whether its to stay, to visit for the day, or just join us for a free meal, we always encourage people to come. This has proven very useful in interacting with local people as we daily have people visit us from the local villages, Pondicherry and other surrounding areas. In 2016 we started Children’s Land. This is a place where local children from villages, schools and underprivileged backgrounds can come to enjoy nature and play at our recycled tyres playground. We provide transport for the children, fresh fruit, volunteers to facilitate and play with the children and most days we have a music teacher for the children to learn music if they want. Earlier this year, in January we opened up the free vegan Sadhana Forest Tea Hut which is open Monday to Friday in the mornings and afternoons. This is a place where local people,volunteers, visitors and guests can all come together and enjoy this beautiful community space. We serve Vegan Ayurvedic Tea and Laddus without expecting any money from anyone. We also offer free workshops here in the afternoons where we have a mix of locals and volunteers attend. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us, either through our email India@sadhanforest.org or come and visit us again. We would love to have one of our long-term volunteers show you around, and answer any questions you may have. Thanks again! Sadhana Forest

Way of Life!
May 2019 • Solo
Established in 2003, the founder members and volunteers of Sadhana have come a long way, to put Sadhana where it is today. The place is an almost self sustaining community that has been focusing on giving back to the nature, for we are always in its debt.
I was at Sadhana today (29 May 2019), for the first time, after years of failed planning. I was and am still astonished about how carefully each and every day-to-day activity is planned in this community.
I am inspired by them for working towards improving the lifestyle of all the living creatures. The planning that has gone into usage of water, consumption of food and disposal of waste amongst many others is the need of the hour in today's world.
Unfortunately, I couldn't participate in the activities except the tour because of my time crunch but I definitely hope to return for a longer stay.
Sadhana is not just a place to experience the bliss of nature, but is a way of life.
It's a must visit place if you're visiting Pondicherry and Auroville. The volunteers are an energetic bunch and are very jovial with their visitors. Kudos to Sadhana and its volunteers for all their efforts! 🤘

Thank you.

I volunteered at Sadhana Forest for a month and it was absolutely life changing.
I arrived as a smoking, alcoholic meat eater. Not only did the community (or Family I'd rather say) offer so much support that it made it easy quit smoking and drinking - but they also introduced me to the delicious world of veganism. As someone who has always had a problem with eating, I went from eating very little, to have 3 large meals with fruit snacks inbetween every day, and feel amazing for it!!
I've learned so much about the world, the benefits of veganism both for health and ethically, about unschooling, the water crisis, gift economy, and the importance of zero waste. It's not just a reforestation project, it's so much more!
I never expected to receive so much education in such a short space of time by so many interesting passionate people from around the world.
The living conditions are very basic which is perfect for the environment you're in, I found it very easy to adjust to.
I definitely recommend doing the "Eco Film Club" on Fridays if you do not have time to volunteer. In just a few hours you learn so much about the project and can take a lot away for yourself, as well as enjoying some delicious vegan food!
It has been extremely rewarding and I look forward to returning in the future.

No matter what your interests are, Sadhana Forest is for you. There is something for everyone here and if being eco-friendly doesn't interest you in any way... then go anyways! The things you learn here are so interesting that no one ever leaves as the same person.. You only improve in many different ways and it's an incredibly fun atmosphere every day

Interesting and very important project
Jan 2019 • Family
Sadhana forest is an incredibly interesting and very important project in the Auroville region. If you are not able to work there as a volunteer and go there just for a visit, choose Friday afternoon. The free bus, starting at Solar Kitchen is the best possibility to go.

Loving Community
Mar 2019 • Solo
Sadhana Forest gave me the opportunity to connect to both nature and the community living here in a very unique way.
After the daily sevas (selfless service) one gets to participate in various workshops, introduce new ideas or spend the afternoon in the neighborhood.
My highlight : the mudpool!

Seeing the forest grow day by day and being an essential part of this process is an experience I hope more people can make.

Shifted to veganism
Oct 2018 • Family
A welcoming community atmosphere where we contributed to the reforestation project and volunteered our time to thsi unique community. We enjoyed eating, cleaning and cooking together. We lived in huts and loved spending our time in nature. A beautiful fun mud pool was a great place to swim and get refreshed.

My youngest daughter loved taking care of the dogs and cats on the property. The biggest surprise was after watching one of the weekly Eco Film showing my children decided to be vegan. They realized that the US food industry is very cruel to animals and they decided to take a stand. Thank you Sadhana Forest for allowing my children to make this imortant decision in their lives by themselves!

Yorit and Aviram, the founders, were great models of following their desires by creating a forest from arid land, not just in India but in Haiti and Kenya as well. I was truly inspired by the time my children and I spent here. It gave me permission to dream big about community living in my country of choice. A must stay!

Great project, welcoming space
Feb 2019 • Solo
I did the Friday tour which was a great experience. The tour was very informative, the guy taking us round was knowledgeable and presented the information well and in a friendly, welcoming manner.
The project itself is great and much needed, and it was nice to see and hear that so many people volunteer there, giving something back to humanity.
Overall great place, nice tour, worth going.

A magic place
Feb 2019 • Solo
Sadhana, it's waking up at dawn to hug and plant. It's spending at least 3 hours "eating", to share on various subjects. It's being inspired by dozens of crazy stories from long terms or new volunteers. It's discovering Auroville one afternoon here and there.

Sadhana, it's living in the forest, with the forest. Listening singing birds and biting mosquitoes. It's observing green shades and smelling wood parfume and bristle in the hut.

Sadhana, it's getting your energy level on maximum through contact with people, and with a project that makes sense. It's confronting yourself with a very unusual lifestyle, so healthier. It's living veganism, unschooling, gift economy and compassion. It's being forced to think about the future we want to live.

I have stayed there 27 days. Enough to get deep into it, develop friendship. Not enough to be bored. Everyday has surprised me, i enjoyed every moment.

This place fits my personality. Sevas, including some for the environment, and some optional workshops and activities. Mostly a lot of time with people to share and meet, deeply and in awareness. I would not stay longer for 3 reasons. First, because my journey is about new places all the time. About leaving for other discoveries. Secondly because there is a bit too many people to feel at home very long. It takes me effort to meet and especially remember peoples life. Finally because if one day i participate in creating a place like this, i want it to be in Belgium or France, not other side of the world. It makes more sense for me.

Sadhana Forest changed me. I will never forget it. I keep deep in my mind and heart a part of this fabulous place. This community where magic of the environment is as great as the people staying there.

You will not leave Sadhana Forest the same person as when you arrived!!!
Jan 2019 • Solo
I have recently returned to the UK having had the experience of a lifetime staying at Sadhana Forest. I am disabled and spent three weeks over the New Year with my mobility scooter living in a hut in the forest amongst the kindest and most compassionate people I have ever met. What a fantastic start to 2019 with each day bringing something completely new and exciting. Various evening talks on core values such as ‘veganism’, ‘gift economy’ and ‘unschooling’ brought about profound changes within me, especially as I am a school teacher! I found the ‘sharing circle’ to be surprisingly liberating and empowering. Despite my limited contribution due to my chronic health condition I was made to feel that I had a valuable role inspiring others with my determined approach within this non-judgemental community. Sadhana Forest was a culturally and emotionally immersive experience that has completely altered my mind-set. I have returned to the UK with a ‘can-do’ attitude, feeling so much more positive about my own future and the future of our planet which has been taken for granted. I would love to be in a position to return to this truly special and unique environment to see in 2020!

Amazing and inspiring place
Jan 2019 • Solo
I first came to sadhana after hearing of their Friday night eco film night through the visitors centre. I instantly fell in love with the place and came back the next day to volunteer for a month! I’ve never lived in such a caring community where the project is so worthwhile. Can’t recommend this place enough even just for a day visit, I can’t wait to come back in the future!!

One of the most sustainable places on earth you can find - must see!
Jan 2019 • Solo
I was lucky enough to be able to volunteer at Sadhana forest and I'm incredibly grateful for this experience! Sadhana is such a peaceful and soothing place - being in the middle of a forest simply calms you down. I am amazed by what they have achieved over the years and how energetically they still keep going and engage everyone around them.
The sevas I did were lots of fun and a great opportunity to get to know everyone from this diverse community better. And then the food - their vegan kitchen is just incredible, i enjoyed every meal, so you should definitely not miss out on that!
But lastly, the community I met there and got to be part of was something I will never forget - they way I was welcomed there and made to feel at home was very unique.
So, if you'd like to learn more about sustainable living in a great community - don't miss a chance to visit Sadhana or volunteer there :)

An Awesome place to Visit
Jan 2019 • Friends
This is one of the best place in Pondicherry to visit. Honestly speaking we didn't know about that place but luckily our Villa was near about that place so while exploring the things we came to know about that place.
If you're are looking for a place where you can get peace and happiness then this is the right place for you.Apart from peace and happiness this place will teach you so many things and will change your perspective towards your life.I wondered very few people know about this place and even Pondicherry tourism is also not promoting it.
This is one of the best place, I have visited till now and will love to visit it again and again.
At the end I will Love to thanks entire sadhana forest team for doing a great job and spread happiness.

Must visit place in Pondicherry
Jan 2019 • Friends
My visit to sadhna forest was totally unplanned. Never heard or seen anywhere about it before but i am lucky to experience the serenity and peace that this place offers. Aiden,hailing from Britain who was my Guide, is a great person who give us the walk through the forest and the way of living of the volunteers out there. It gives eternal peace after having knowing about the way of life of the people living in the Sadhna forest. I found a great diversity of people from all around the globe like US, UK, Israil, Thailand, etc. It was really great experience. Looking forward to volunteer in the near future.

A beautiful, simple and conscious way of life
Dec 2018 • Solo
A beautiful, simple way of life driven by so much love and compassion. If you’re looking to experience a more sustainable and conscious life and somewhere that truly embodies the promise of Auroville, I cannot recommend Sadhana Forest enough. Whether you’re looking to visit or in search of somewhere to call home for a while, Sadhana offers so much for everyone. The connections you make and the insights you gain through experiencing life at Sadhana are invaluable.

Amazing place

Sadhana Forest is an AMAZING place. I applied for 6 months of volunteering in Sadhana Forest and everyday is more and more interesting here, it's a place where you can meet so many people of different nationality and different life feedback and knowledge. You can learn a lot about reforestation, veganism, unschooling, how to live in harmony with the nature, how to live consciously on the earth... I can make a very long list. Sadhana is a real place to help you to grow with the people and with the nature. You have to go in there!

Vegan volunteer community
Jan 2019 • Solo
I have been in Sadhana Forest India for over & year now, and plan to stay stay for at least another year. This is not just a project to grow trees but to also grow people. Seeing how it has inspired myself and many people who visit on a far more positive environment and lifestyle, is great to see. A better world is possible and this place is definitely a large step in the right direction.

A wholly wonderful and immersive experience
Nov 2018 • Solo
Sadhana Forest is a gem of a community where one can truly understand how compassion is tangible and not just an abstract concept to be debated about in armchairs. The project reflects compassion towards animals through its 100% vegan food and by providing a Forest home for the insects, reptiles and birds inhabitants; compassion towards people with its environment of cooperation and collaboration; compassion towards the curious mind with its unschooling philosophy; and compassion towards the planet through the reforestation efforts directly. It's always been a pleasure to attend the tours and to see the project in action. It truly is a little slice of paradise.

Wow How Inspiring to Visit this Reforestation Project.
Dec 2018 • Couples
An incredible experience also donation based, of what dedicated people from around the world have created.. This place was a desert, now its a lush forest with an ever increasing water table in this area. You get a free bus ride to and from the solar kitchen car parking area, then you are taken to the central hub in the forest for a 2 hrs talk about the reforestation project including the educational side to it..then we watching a documentary and had a vegan meal together.. The whole experience took about 5.5. hrs. Incredible value and insight to how to build a forest.

A breathtaking place
Oct 2018 • Solo
I stayed at Sadhana Forest for 2 weeks and found it to be a magical environment. At first I was a little overwhelmed living there but I quickly adapted and embraced it. It is admirable how they have managed to reduce waste to such an extent, and re-use as much as they can. The 3 homemade, vegan meals served daily are delicious! Volunteering there is a unique experience and supports a wonderful cause for restoring the planet.

I highly recommend attending the tour & film night which happens every Friday.

I will be returning

A MUST to visit- the essence of AUROVILLE
Sep 2018 • Solo
If there is ONE association that I trust and beleive in with all my heart, this is the one!

They work with volonteers to conserve the water on the land, they plant trees and live an engaged, ethical, zero waste lifestyle in community.

They invite us every Friday to visit them, eat a delicious vegan meal for free and watch excellent documentaries. The bus leaves at 16h from the solar kitchen in Auroville and comes back in the evening. An other bus leaves at 18h if you did the visit already and want to join for the dinner and the movie.

A visit not to miss of you are in the area 💛 loads of love and good energy 💛

An amazing place to visit in Auroville
Jan 2018 • Solo
The forest is so beautiful that it is hard to imagine there was nothing when Sadhana Forest started its wonderful work here. There is also an inspiring atmosphere between the volunteers who love to share their passion for Sadhana Forest with you and explain the project and the completely sustainable way of life: solar energy, the sparing of water resources, the local and natural construction of the huts... the overall joy and attentiveness is heartwarming and inspiring, very in line with the unity dream of Auroville.

Sadhana has been an amazing experiment for the last 10 years, based in Auroville and run by a aurovilian family they have a flow of visitors and volunteers to sustain the place.

Inspirational community united by the power of intention
Mar 2018 • Couples
I have visited Sadhana Forest 3 times over the past five years, each time staying for about a month. I began visiting the project mainly because I believe that the ecological work being done there is important. Many projects plant food forests but few focus there resources on preserving ecosystems that are threatened by extinction. Seeing the utter transformation of the land over the past 14 years is stunning, but while it is easy to recognize the ecological work being done at Sadhana it is the community work that has really stuck with me over the years. The community structure provides a safe space for families and solo travelers alike to experience powerful growth, friendship, learning and spiritual growth. The substance free policies, clean vegan food, and commitment to non-violence give people space to reimagine the way that they wish to live their life and the values that they hold most dear. I am grateful for the existence of this project because I know that I will always have a home there and a playground for exploring self and building my extended family and community around the world. I cannot recommend taking the time to volunteer here more highly.

Amazing what a vision and dedicated volunteers can do
Mar 2018 • Solo
I've taken the tour of the India forest twice - and each time seeing the before pictures of the desert and then walking through the lush forest just over a decade after Sadhana started amazed me. You can tell they learned much and put forward best practices as they learned.

In addition to the primary goal of raising the water table, I applaud their efforts in creating Children's space for the local village children. I volunteered at a primary school for a few weeks and one of the first things the kids told me was how much they enjoyed going to Sadhana.

I must admit that I personally would have a problem living there (sadly, I like my creature comforts too much), there are many volunteers who enjoy the experience and thrive there.

I am also impressed with Aviram's vision of expanding to Haiti, Kenya, and maybe other areas of the world in the future with reforestation efforts designed to meet the needs of the local population.

Great Experience
Jun 2017 • Family
The walk through the forest is beautiful, and the community itself offers a once-in-a-lifetime experience (for most people). It's an immersive journey with an educational movie-viewing - (normally pertaining to some environmental issue, we saw 'The Cove', and it isn't for the weak of stomach) - and of course, a fully vegan meal. So if you're interested in getting a true taste of Auroville, this is definitely a wonderful place to begin.

If there is one place to see in Auroville, it's Sadhana Forest!
Mar 2018 • Couples
Sadhana Forest is a reforestation and water conservation project, run by volunteers. 14 years ago a family startet this project in the middle of nowhere. Today you find a beautiful forest with thousands of birds. But there is still a lot to do. More trees need to be planted, the younger trees need to be watered and mulched and huge holes have to be dug, to keep the monsoon water on the dry land. But water conservation is not only about digging holes-it's also about using less water for washing hands and for flushing the toilets. Sadhana is also a beautiful vegan community which supports all volunteers. 2018 was my first time at Sadhana Forest, but for sure not my last time. Thank you Sadhana for letting me grow trees and also my personality.

This place changed my life!
Feb 2018 • Couples
The Sadhana Forest community is one of the best places to learn about an eco friendly lifestyle, reforestation, sustainability, water conservation, compassion, vegan food and lifestyle and a thousand other things related to this topics. For me it was a life changing experience and I enjoyed every single moment of my stay. If you like to get a first impression of Sadhana forest I can highly recommend to visit on Friday, there is a free Bus from Auroville, a guided tour around the community and the forest, the eco-film-club in the evening and an awesome vegan meal, all free of charge!

Incredibly beautiful and exciting place
Oct 2017 • Solo
I went to one of the Friday tours and that was the time when I got totally blown away. They have so many good ideas about sustainable living and re-planting a forest. Also they show a movie and offer a delicious meal. I stayed longer afterwards to experience more of the work that is done there and enjoyed every moment of my stay.

Afforestation project by auroville
Nov 2017 • Friends
Tree planting for the advanced... The whole project focuses on afforestation of the area they manage and living in synch with nature. Trying to have a minimal impact on nature by saving water in many ways. Every Friday they organise a tour that will pick you up at solar kitchen at 4pm and take you to the forest for a guided explanation tour of the camp then an educational movie, vegan dinner cooked by the volunteers and then drop back at solar kitchen around 9pm.
Have to see them if you're in auroville on a Friday

Amazing and inspiring place, don't miss it.
Feb 2018 • Solo
Sadhana Forest is an amazing project doing important work. In 14 years they have brought an enormous amount of plant and animal life back to their land, while at the same time exposing thousands of guests to reforestation, water conservation, vegan food, natural architecture, solar power, conscious living, and more. Anyone visiting the Pondicherry/Auroville area should come for the weekly Friday tour and free vegan meal.

Wonderful Experience!
Feb 2018 • Couples
Sadhana Forest is an incredible amazing place. This community is such a good example of living a sustainable and compassionate lifestyle. It includes all the aspects from using compost toilets and reducing water waste to being vegan and taking care of cows in a cow sanctuary. Thank you Sadhana Forest for you warm, loving and welcoming community and for being a great example to many of us!

Life-changing experience - people need to know about this place!!!
Feb 2018 • Couples
I have been on multiple tours of Sadhana Forest and am absolutely blown away by this incredible organization!!! Reforestation, water conservation, sustainable energy, vegan lifestyle, zero-waste, drug-free, ecoconscious, natural building, animal sanctuary, community life and compassion in action – these are the keywords I have in my mind when I think of Sadhana Forest. Thank you for showing me that it is possible to live in harmony with nature, animals and humans! For me Sadhana Forest is the living example of what’s possible if you take Mahatma Gandhi literally: ‘Be the change you want to see in the world’ :)

A place to live with nature
Mar 2024 • Couples
I think the 10 days at Sadhana Forest were more like learning about the art of life than an ordinary experience. Nature is not a place to visit, It’s home. The article caught my eye. A place where people live as part of nature, it gave me a new sense of the fact that humans are a part of nature and are connected to nature, and it was a wonderful time where I could completely focus on the present moment.
I gained a lot of positive motivation while living in the forest in a community with various people from all over the world. We were able to volunteer together and learn a lot about various cultures. Selfless Service While doing Seba, I was able to notice myself changing every day, and I was able to feel more deeply that not only humans but all living beings have emotions and that each and every one of them is precious.

Here, we take direct action in our daily lives in a way that causes as little harm to nature as possible. Dry toilets that don't flush, amazing alternative ways to shower, wash your hands and wash dishes with ashes while saving water. Soap and shampoo are also used as ecologically biodegradable products. People with bright energy who try to live as human beings who are part of nature gather here.
After experiencing the vegan lifestyle for 10 days, I gained a new perspective and a lot of interest in what it means to be vegan and not getting anything from animals. I think I will miss the healthy diet of fruits and vegetables that I ate here.

In addition, any community member can create various workshops such as yoga, meditation, dance, and sound bath, and the space to share talents is open at any time.
As I slept in a cabin with no fans or lights, and used a bathroom with a view of the sky and stars, I gradually got used to the feelings that were unfamiliar and uncomfortable at first. The power to accept many things has increased.

Sanada Forest is a time of meditation where you can look at every moment with new eyes, and I think you can make positive changes to yourself and to many people just by coming here.

A school where I learn about myself through forests and nature
Mar 2024 • Couples
We are a Korean couple volunteering at Sadhana Forest. There don't seem to be many reviews here in Korean, so I'm leaving a post because I thought it would be helpful.

first of all! I think it would be good if I could tell you what kind of place Sadhana Forest is. It is a place that is difficult to define in one word, but I think it is a place where people who love forests and nature gather. It is also a space of practice where you can learn about others and get to know yourself better, and at the same time find answers.

All of the people gathered here are volunteers. I have seen people staying for as short as 4 days, 10 days, and as long as 7 years. I wake up at 5:30 in the morning, do seva (selfless service) for about 5 hours in the morning, and spend my time freely in the afternoon. There are various community events where discussions and talent shows are held. Anyone with talent can hold a workshop and share it.

The lifestyle is very nature-friendly. All meals are prepared vegan. Urine and faeces are treated with fertilizer, shampoo and toothpaste are all natural, and dishwashing is done with ash from a fire, not with pong. Individuals under 40 years old live in dormitories, while people over 40 years old or couples live in independent cabins. There is not even a common ceiling fan in the cabin. Electricity use is only possible when the sun rises. It seems like an unfamiliar environment for Koreans. You have to pay 600 rupees per person per day to the community, including all meals and accommodation. (Exemption for long-term volunteers)

People seem to gather here for their own reasons. Some people come to Sadhana Forest out of passion for the forest, others out of hope for the vegan community, and still others out of simple curiosity. We came because we were curious about Auroville, a spiritual community, and especially Sadhana Forest, a community that lives a vegan lifestyle while tending the forest.

I have never been vegan or vegetarian. While talking with many friends here, I was able to think about the environment, animal rights, unschooling, and a way of life that could be an alternative to capitalism. Rather than simply a place to plant trees and take care of the forest, I think it serves as a school that teaches the importance of nature.

If you are tired of life and feeling disconnected from nature, if you are wondering if it is really right to live like this, or if there is a different way to live, it would be a good idea to come to Sadhana Forest and sweat together to find the answer.

Experience beyond words
Feb 2024 • Friends
Today is the ninth day in Sadhana Forest. I am getting more and more accustomed to living in the forest, feeling comfortable and calm. I mentioned to a friend a while ago that I was about to travel to India and I would fly to the city of Chennai. He mentioned Auroville to me and he thought I would like this area. He mentioned Sadhana Forest in particular and decided to go to India. The first stop was Sadhana Forest. I also wanted to experience life in a volunteer based community.
This is my first experience of living with a community. We have different tasks that require division of labor every day. We will get up early together, cook, clean, go to the forest to water... and so on. As long as the forest needs help, we all need help. We'll all do it together. In Sadhana you will meet friends from all over the world, just like a big family, and you will get to know everyone easily. There are different tasks every day, you will seva (selfless service) with different people, and you will also have various activities. You can participate in various workshops and activities. After the afternoon seva, you can go out and explore the surroundings, or you can enjoy the quietness and comfort in the forest. There is a mud pool if you want to soak in the water, and a library if you want to read a book. Books, meditation hut. If you want a quiet little space, you can meditate, do yoga or sleep. I occasionally walk to the Tea hut to have a cup of coconut milk chai. I really enjoyed my time in the forest, and the time will slip away unconsciously and you won't realize it. Whether you want to meet new friends, learn about their forest restoration methods, or experience group life, come to Sadhana Forest. It will be an unforgettable memory. Thank you Sadhana Forest!

Great experience to live a different lifestyle
Feb 2024 • Solo
My time in the Sadhana Forest was incredibly inspiring. I have never found a place where values are learned and lived that are so close to my ideal idea of living together and are consistent. So many things are combined, from the way of life, the food to the way we treat each other. People from all over the world meet and are welcome.
It is important to know that a stay here (or living here - for those who are interested) is not to be confused with a vacation. Physical work, rules and a predetermined structure are part of the whole. This can be very exhausting and a little disappointing for some who need more creative freedom. But if you are open and get involved in life here, you quickly get used to the lifestyle and routines.
I particularly like the forest, where I go for walks almost during the day. The many birds...the sun...the lake where you can swim.
I can only recommend everyone to come here and have this experience. Even if you don't want to live a lifestyle like this, you take so much home with you.

Sadhana review
Dec 2023 • Friends

I was able to continuously discover a new me. Unlike in Korea, in Sadhana, instead of lying down exhausted from “alone time,” I was able to draw, gain new inspiration, communicate with beautiful cows, and feel the sense that my body and mind were alive and healthy. I love that feeling. I want to come back for a long time to this place where I can feel alive.

An attempt to navigate the path of community
Dec 2023 • Friends
Experimenting with alternatives is always difficult. Because I'm going down a path that doesn't exist. It is not easy to lose one's original intention and continue for a long time. However, I think it is very meaningful that so many people are coming and going for such a long time without losing their original intention.
I like the daily structure of doing seva in the morning and doing free time and various community activities in the afternoon. I think it is a sustainable way to steadily realize the original purpose of Sadhana step by step, while having the opportunity to meet a variety of people.
At first, I was a little embarrassed by the hard and strict restraints, but as time went by, I began to understand why these rules were in place.
Although there are long-term volunteers, the majority stay for 8 to 20 days, or at most 6 months to a year, so I am worried about what to do to truly form a village and live in this way.

On a typical trip, you can't interact with this many people. I think that's the biggest charm of this place. Even if you're not fluent in English, let's sweat and work together and share our hearts.

Unique experience
Dec 2023 • Solo
I stayed two weeks as a volunteer at sadhana forest, it was truly a unique experience which advocates beautiful values such as veganism, minimalism, zero waste. The primary goal is to plant trees and conserve water.

We wake up at 6 a.m. to do some stretching and participate in community life, some will plant trees, others will chop wood, take care of meals and the hygiene of the different places. We work for around 5 hours with a break for breakfast.
In the afternoon we are free, there are often artistic activities that the volunteers offer. There is also a mudpool where you can swim, it is a very popular place.

It took me a few days to adapt to the living conditions, because even if I knew roughly what to expect, it's different to live it but in the end I got used to it pretty quickly.

There are volunteers from all over the world, which allows you to travel while staying in the same place.

I highly recommend everyone to come and experience it, the participation is 600 rupees per day to be able to pay for the meals, which is equivalent to around €7.

I will definitely come back.
